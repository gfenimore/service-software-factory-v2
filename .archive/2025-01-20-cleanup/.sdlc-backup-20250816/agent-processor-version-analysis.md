- Story-builder agents: **August 14, 2025**

### Git History Analysis

From commit `31cc0a1` (August 14, 2025 - "feat(us-006): complete service locations feature"):

- Modified **19 processor files** in experimental location
- Modified **3 story-builder versions** in experimental location
- Added `integration-specialist.md` to core location

### File Size Comparison

| Processor             | Core Size   | Experimental Size | Difference               |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| hook-processor.md     | 8,491 bytes | 8,156 bytes       | Core is 335 bytes larger |
| type-processor.md     | 4,111 bytes | 3,931 bytes       | Core is 180 bytes larger |
| scaffold-processor.md | 5,503 bytes | 5,271 bytes       | Core is 232 bytes larger |
| react-processor.md    | 7,240 bytes | 6,856 bytes       | Core is 384 bytes larger |

**Note**: Core versions are consistently slightly larger, suggesting they may have additional content.

## 🎯 Recommendations

### KEEP These Versions (Most Recent/Complete):

#### From Core Location (`.sdlc/01-core/`)

1. **All Agents** - These appear to be the canonical versions:
   - `architect-agent.md` (v5)
   - `developer.md` (v4.3)
   - `devops-agent.md` (v6)
   - `planner-agent.md` (v5.2) - Updated Aug 13
   - `tester-agent.md` (v3)
   - `testbuilder-agent.md` (v1)

2. **Processors** - Core versions are slightly larger/more complete:
   - All processors in `.sdlc/01-core/A-agents/processors/`
   - Especially `integration-specialist.md` (only exists in core)

#### From Experimental Location (`.sdlc/12-sdlc-design/.../08-factory/`)

1. **Story-Builder Latest**:
   - `story-builder-v21.md` - This is v2.1, the latest version
   - Archive v1.0 and v2.0 versions

## 🗂️ Consolidation Plan

### Step 1: Verify Latest Versions

```bash
# Check for any uncommitted changes
git status

# Ensure we have the latest
git pull
```

### Step 2: Create Backup

```bash
# Backup current state before consolidation
cp -r .sdlc .sdlc-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Step 3: Consolidation Structure

```
.sdlc/
├── 01-core/
│   ├── agents/
│   │   ├── architect-agent.md (v5)
│   │   ├── developer.md (v4.3)
│   │   ├── devops-agent.md (v6)
│   │   ├── planner-agent.md (v5.2)
│   │   ├── story-builder.md (v2.1 from experimental)
│   │   ├── tester-agent.md (v3)
│   │   └── testbuilder-agent.md (v1)
│   └── processors/
│       ├── hook-processor.md (v1.0)
│       ├── integration-specialist.md (v1.0)
│       ├── invocation-generator.md (v1.0)
│       ├── modify-processor.md (v1.0)
│       ├── processor-selector.md (v2.0)
│       ├── react-processor.md (v1.0)
│       ├── react-test-processor.md (v1.0)
│       ├── scaffold-processor.md (v1.0)
│       ├── type-processor.md (v1.0)
│       └── test-twins/
│           └── [all test twin files]
└── 09-archive/
    ├── agents/
    │   ├── story-builder-v1.md
    │   ├── story-builder-v2.md
    │   └── [other superseded versions]
    └── processors/
        └── [any superseded versions]
```

### Step 4: Remove Duplicates

```bash
# Remove experimental duplicates after verification
rm -rf .sdlc/12-sdlc-design/sdlc-experimental/08-factory/processors/
rm -rf .sdlc/12-sdlc-design/sdlc-experimental/08-factory/agents/

# Remove archived versions from 09-archive/old-processors/
# (already properly archived)
```

### Step 5: Update References

- Update pipeline definition to point to consolidated locations
- Update any scripts that reference old paths
- Update documentation

## ⚠️ Critical Notes

1. **Story-Builder v2.1** in experimental is the newest (Aug 14) and should replace the v1.0 in core
2. **Integration-Specialist** only exists in core (added Aug 14) - keep this
3. **Core processors** appear more complete (larger file sizes) - prefer these
4. **Test twins** exist in both locations but appear identical - keep core versions

---

## 🔍 Verification Commands

After consolidation, verify:

```bash
# Check all agents have version numbers
grep -h "^# .* v[0-9]" .sdlc/01-core/agents/*.md

# Check all processors have version numbers
grep -h "^# .* v[0-9]" .sdlc/01-core/processors/*.md

# Ensure no broken references
grep -r "sdlc-experimental/08-factory" .sdlc/

# Verify build still works
npm run type-check
npm run build
```

## 📝 Summary

**Most Recent Modifications**:

- August 14, 2025: Major processor update in experimental (US-006 feature)
- August 13, 2025: Planner and Story-Builder updates in core
- August 11, 2025: Major reorganization

**Recommendation**: Use **core location** as primary, except for Story-Builder v2.1 from experimental. The core versions appear more complete based on file sizes, and the experimental versions were likely test copies for US-006 development.

_This analysis ensures we retain the most recent and complete versions of all mission-critical components._
