# SDLC Audit Summary - August 10, 2025

## üìä Key Findings

### File Distribution

- **Total Files**: 149
- **Agents/Processors**: 45 files (30%)
- **User Stories**: 11 files (7%)
- **Technical Docs**: 2 files (1%)
- **Reports**: 21 files (14%)
- **Investigations**: 16 files (11%)
- **Operational**: 12 files (8%)

### Critical Observations

#### üéØ Product Requirements vs SDLC Process

**Product Specs (16 files)** - Should move to `/product-specs`:

- All files in `05-backlog/A-accounts/`
- Master view feature definition
- User stories (US-004, US-005)
- Architecture documents
- Task breakdowns

#### üóÑÔ∏è Archive Candidates (33 files)

**Completed/Obsolete Items**:

- Completed investigations in `validation/investigations/completed/`
- Old processor versions in `01-core/G-agent-archive/`
- Completed reports older than 30 days
- Duplicate documentation

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Files to Preserve (75 files)

- All current agents and processors in `01-core/A-agents/`
- Active manifests (processor-manifest.json files)
- Current architecture documents
- Test twin specifications
- Session tracking and state files

## üéØ Recommended Actions for Azure DevOps Integration

### 1. Immediate Actions

```
‚úÖ Create /product-specs folder structure
‚úÖ Move all user stories from 05-backlog to product-specs
‚úÖ Archive completed investigations
‚úÖ Clean up duplicate processor versions
```

### 2. Folder Structure Reorganization

```
/product-specs/              (NEW - Product Requirements)
  /accounts/
    /master-view/
      - user-stories/
      - architecture/
      - task-breakdowns/
    /list-view/
  /operations/
  /administration/

/.sdlc/                      (SDLC Process & Tools)
  /01-core/                  (Keep as-is)
  /02-integrations/          (Keep as-is)
  /03-knowledge/             (Keep as-is)
  /04-metrics/               (Keep as-is)
  /05-active-work/           (Rename from backlog)
  /06-patterns/              (Keep as-is)
  /07-operations/            (Keep as-is)
  /08-architecture/          (Keep as-is)
  /09-archive/               (Expand with completed items)
```

### 3. Azure DevOps Mapping

| Current Location      | Azure DevOps Target | Action                |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| User Stories (US-xxx) | Work Items          | Create as PBIs        |
| Task Breakdowns       | Work Item Tasks     | Link to parent PBIs   |
| Architecture Docs     | Wiki Pages          | Import as markdown    |
| Processor Specs       | Wiki/Repos          | Store as reference    |
| Test Twins            | Test Plans          | Convert to test cases |
| Reports               | Dashboard/Wiki      | Archive or convert    |

### 4. Files Requiring Special Attention

- `master-view-feature.md` - Core vision document, make it a wiki homepage
- `processor-manifest-*.json` - Active configs, keep in repo
- Session summaries - Good for sprint retrospectives
- Investigation reports - Convert to ADO issues/bugs

## üìã Migration Checklist

- [ ] Review and approve this audit
- [ ] Create `/product-specs` folder structure
- [ ] Move user stories and requirements (git mv)
- [ ] Archive completed investigations
- [ ] Update all file references
- [ ] Create ADO work items from user stories
- [ ] Import architecture docs to wiki
- [ ] Set up build pipelines for scripts
- [ ] Commit with clear reorganization message
- [ ] Tag current state before major reorg

## üöÄ Benefits After Reorganization

1. **Clear Separation**: Product specs vs SDLC process
2. **ADO Ready**: User stories map directly to work items
3. **Cleaner Structure**: No mixing of requirements and tools
4. **Better Tracking**: Active work vs archived items
5. **Git Preserved**: All history maintained through proper moves

_This reorganization will prepare the project for seamless Azure DevOps integration while maintaining all historical context in Git._
