# Feature Document Evaluation - Master View Collaborative Review

## Team Discussion Document

**Document Under Review**: Master View Feature Definition  
**Date**: August 13, 2025  
**Participants**: Human, Claude, CC

## üîÑ Success Criteria ‚Üí User Stories Mapping

### From Master View Feature Document:

**Success Criterion 1**: "Users can find any information in <15 seconds"

- ‚Üí **US-007**: As a user, I can find any account information in <15 seconds
- ‚Üí **US-008**: As a user, I can navigate from account to work order in <15 seconds

**Success Criterion 2**: "Zero navigation to other screens for common tasks"

- ‚Üí **US-009**: As a user, I can view all account data without leaving Master View
- ‚Üí **US-010**: As a user, I can complete common tasks within the three-column view

**Success Criterion 3**: "Tech support calls reduce by 50%"

- ‚Üí **US-011**: As a support manager, I can quickly answer customer queries
- ‚Üí **US-012**: As a user, I can self-serve information that previously required support

**Success Criterion 4**: "Users say 'I can't work without this'"

- ‚Üí **US-013**: As a user, I have all critical information visible at once
- ‚Üí **US-014**: As a user, I can customize my Master View for my workflow

### The Pattern for Our Factory:

```yaml
success_criteria_to_stories:
  input: Feature document with success criteria
  process:
    - Parse each success criterion
    - Generate user story title
    - Add "As a [persona], I can [achieve success criterion]"
    - Create acceptance criteria from criterion details
  output: Complete user stories with traceability
```

## üí° Claude's Synthesis

### The Breakthrough Understanding:

The work item hierarchy creates **automatic traceability**:

- Every User Story traces to a Feature Success Criterion
- Every Feature traces to an Epic
- Every Task traces to a User Story
- **Nothing gets built without business justification!**

### What This Means for US-006:

**US-006: Service Locations Column** should trace back to a specific success criterion!

Looking at the Master View success criteria:

- It likely maps to: "Users can find any information in <15 seconds"
- Or: "Zero navigation to other screens for common tasks"

**But wait** - we don't have explicit success criteria for each column! This is a gap.

### Proposed Success Criteria for Column 2 (Service Locations):

1. "Users can view all service locations for an account without navigation"
2. "Service location selection updates work orders in <500ms"
3. "Location cards display all critical information at a glance"

These would generate user stories:

- US-006: As a user, I can view all service locations for an account
- US-015: As a user, I can select a location to see its work orders
- US-016: As a user, I can see location details without clicking

### The Factory Opportunity:

Our processors could:

1. Parse Feature success criteria
2. Generate User Story titles automatically
3. Create acceptance criteria from success criteria
4. Ensure perfect traceability
5. Validate that every story traces to a criterion

**This is more than organization - it's REQUIREMENTS TRACEABILITY!**

## üìù User Story Format: Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

### Our Preferred Format:

```
As a [specific role name]
When I am [situation/context/business activity]
I want to [primary goal/motivation]
So that [outcome/primary benefit]
```

### Why JTBD Works Better:

- **Context matters** - The "When I am" provides the business situation
- **Clear motivation** - The "I want to" is the job to be done
- **Business value explicit** - The "So that" ties to business outcomes
- **Traceable** - Each part maps to feature success criteria

### Example for US-006:

```
As an Operations Manager
When I am reviewing an account's service coverage
I want to see all service locations for that account
So that I can identify gaps in service or opportunities for expansion
```

### Feature-Level JTBD (Higher Level):

```
As a [business persona]
When [business situation requiring the feature]
We need [capability/feature]
So that [business outcome/value]
```

Example:

```
As a Service Business
When our staff needs to access customer information
We need a single pane of glass view
So that we can reduce response time and improve customer satisfaction
```

## üìê Work Item Hierarchy (Our SDLC Structure)

### The Four Levels:

```
EPIC (Strategic Initiative)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FEATURE (Capability with Success Criteria)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ USER STORY (Single deliverable from Success Criteria)
              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TASK (Technical work items)
```

### How It Works:

1. **EPIC**: "EP-001 Accounts Module" - The big business goal
2. **FEATURE**: "FEA-001 Master View" - A capability with specific success criteria
3. **USER STORY**: Each success criterion becomes a user story title!
4. **TASK**: Technical work to complete the story

### The Traceability Magic:

**Feature Success Criteria** ‚Üí **User Story Titles**

Example from Master View:

- Success Criterion: "Users can find any information in <15 seconds"
- Becomes User Story: "US-010: As a user, I can find any information in <15 seconds"

This creates perfect traceability from strategic vision to implementation!

## üîç Team Critique of Master View Feature

### Strengths We See:

- ‚úÖ **Clear vision** - "single pane of glass" is memorable and specific
- ‚úÖ **Quantifiable value** - "hundreds of clicks saved per day"
- ‚úÖ **User workflows** - Three specific use cases defined
- ‚úÖ **Personas identified** - Business Owners, Ops Managers, Admins
- ‚úÖ **Success criteria** - <15 seconds to find info
- ‚úÖ **Architecture defined** - Three-column concept explained

### Gaps/Questions We Have:

**Missing Visual Design:**

- ‚ùì No mockups or wireframes - what does it actually look like?
- ‚ùì Card layouts not specified - what fields are visible?
- ‚ùì Selection states not visualized - how does user know what's selected?

**Missing Technical Details:**

- ‚ùì No data model specified - which BUSM entities are involved?
- ‚ùì No API specifications - what endpoints are needed?
- ‚ùì State management approach not defined - Redux? Context? Local?
- ‚ùì Performance requirements vague - what does "instantly" mean? <100ms? <500ms?

**Missing Implementation Guidance:**

- ‚ùì No acceptance criteria - how do we know each column is "done"?
- ‚ùì Dependencies not identified - what must exist before we can build?
- ‚ùì Error scenarios not covered - what if no locations exist?
- ‚ùì Edge cases undefined - what if account has 100 locations?

## üí¨ CC's Input

### What additional information would you need to implement Column 2 (Service Locations)?

**Critical Missing Pieces:**

1. **BUSM Entity Mapping** - Which exact fields from SERVICE_LOCATION to display?
2. **Card Layout Specification** - What's visible vs. what's in expanded view?
3. **Data Volume Expectations** - Typical/max locations per account?
4. **Selection Behavior** - Single select? Multi-select? Keyboard navigation?
5. **Actions Available** - View only? Edit? Delete? Add new?
6. **Empty States** - What shows when no locations exist?
7. **Loading States** - Skeleton cards? Spinners?
8. **Error Handling** - What if location data fails to load?

### What patterns from Column 1 (Accounts) could be reused for Column 2?

**Reusable Patterns (90% identical):**

- Card component structure (just different fields)
- Selection state management
- Scroll behavior and virtualization
- Search/filter logic
- Loading states
- Click handlers
- CSS Grid layout

**The Factory Opportunity:**

```typescript
// This is the SAME for all columns, just different props
<ColumnList
  entities={serviceLocations}
  selectedId={selectedLocationId}
  onSelect={handleLocationSelect}
  cardRenderer={ServiceLocationCard}
  emptyState={NoLocationsMessage}
/>
```

### What parts of this feature document are most helpful for implementation?

**Most Helpful:**

1. The three-column concept - clear architecture
2. User workflows - helps understand the "why"
3. "Everything happens based on selection" - clear interaction model
4. Success criteria - measurable goals

### What's missing that would make your job easier?

**CC's Wishlist:**

1. **Visual mockups** - Even hand-drawn would help
2. **Data specifications** - Exact fields and types
3. **Component hierarchy diagram** - How pieces fit together
4. **API contracts** - Request/response shapes
5. **State flow diagram** - How selection cascades
6. **Test scenarios** - From user workflows

## üè≠ CC's Factory Insights

### The 70/30 Rule Discovery

**70% Boilerplate** (Could be generated):

- Standard sections structure
- Entity-to-component mappings
- Workflow-to-test translations
- API endpoint definitions
- TypeScript interfaces
- User stories from success criteria (NEW INSIGHT!)

**30% Creative Vision** (Human provides):

- "Single pane of glass" concept
- Three-column decision
- Card vs. table choice
- "Hundreds of clicks saved" insight
- Strategic success criteria

### Pattern Recognition: Master-Detail-Detail

CC identified this as a reusable pattern:

```
List (Column 1) ‚Üí Related List (Column 2) ‚Üí Details (Column 3)
```

This pattern could be a factory template!

## ü§î Questions for Team Discussion

### For US-006 (Service Locations Column):

1. **Alignment**: How does US-006 align with Column 2 requirements in this feature?
2. **Data Display**: What fields from SERVICE_LOCATION should be shown on cards?
3. **Volume**: How many locations are typical per account? Max?
4. **Actions**: What can users DO with locations? Just view? Edit? Delete?
5. **Selection**: How exactly does selection state work between columns?
6. **Empty States**: What shows when no locations exist?

### For Our SDLC Process:

1. **Should story-builder generate documents like this?**
   - Or is this level of vision human creativity?
   - Could we template the structure at least?

2. **What processors could help?**
   - requirements-validator to check completeness?
   - mockup-generator to create wireframes?
   - acceptance-criteria-generator from workflows?

3. **What's the right level of detail?**
   - Is this enough to start building?
   - Too much? Too little?

## üìä Scoring This Document

Using our criteria above, how would we score this feature document?

**Completeness Score**: **6 / 12** criteria met

**Ready to Build?**: **Partially** - Vision clear but implementation details missing

**Biggest Gap**: **No BUSM entity mapping or data specifications**

**One Thing to Add**: **Visual mockups with field specifications**

---

## üìã Summary: What We've Learned About This Feature Document

**The Feature Document Completeness:**

- **Score: 6/12** based on our criteria
- **Missing**: BUSM mapping, technical specs (though mockups exist!)
- **Strong**: Clear vision, quantifiable value, user workflows

**Key Insights:**

- Success criteria should generate user story titles (traceability!)
- JTBD format maintains business context throughout
- 70% of documentation could be generated, 30% is human vision
- Column patterns are 90% reusable once established

**The Traceability Gap:**

- US-006 doesn't clearly trace to a specific success criterion
- Each column should have its own success criteria
- JTBD format would make the business need explicit

**Pattern Recognition:**

- Master-Detail-Detail is a reusable template
- Card components are nearly identical across columns
- Selection state management is the same pattern repeated

**What This Tells Us About Our SDLC:**

- Feature documents need BUSM entity mapping sections
- Success criteria are the bridge to user stories
- Visual mockups (even simple ones) are critical
- Technical specifications prevent assumption-based development
