# Processor Pipeline Investigation Report

## Problem Statement

The processor pipeline reported 8/8 success but failed to create expected files. This breaks our trust model where processors must create exactly what they promise.

## Expected vs Actual Files

### From processor-manifest-vs2.json:

```
Expected Output Files:
1. src/types/account.types.ts         ❌ MISSING
2. src/components/accounts/AccountCard.tsx    ✅ EXISTS
3. src/hooks/useAccounts.ts          ❌ MISSING
4. src/components/accounts/AccountsList.tsx   ✅ EXISTS
```

### What Actually Exists:

```
src/types/accountDetails.types.ts (different name)
src/hooks/useAccountDetails.ts (different name)
src/components/accounts/AccountCard.tsx
src/components/accounts/AccountsList.tsx
```

## Investigation Tasks for Claude Code

### 1. Analyze the Processor Log

```bash
# Full analysis of processor-run-20250809-122909.log
# Find out what each processor actually did vs what it claimed
```

### 2. Check File Creation Patterns

- Did TYPE-PROCESSOR create `accountDetails.types.ts` instead of `account.types.ts`?
- Did HOOK-PROCESSOR reuse existing `useAccountDetails.ts`?
- Why do logs show "✓ Processor completed" without creating expected files?

### 3. Verify Component Dependencies

```bash
# What types/hooks are the components actually using?
grep -n "import.*from.*types" src/components/accounts/*.tsx
grep -n "import.*from.*hooks" src/components/accounts/*.tsx
```

### 4. Root Cause Analysis Questions

1. Are processors detecting and reusing existing files?
2. Are processors creating files with different names than specified?
3. Is there a mismatch between manifest paths and processor behavior?
4. Did the Claude CLI tool modify file paths?

### 5. Create Prevention Strategy

We need to implement:

#### A. Immediate Validation

```bash
# After each processor, verify output file exists
if [ ! -f "$OUTPUT_FILE" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Processor claimed success but file not created: $OUTPUT_FILE"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### B. Manifest Validation Script

```javascript
// validate-processor-output.js
const manifest = require('./processor-manifest.json')
const fs = require('fs')

manifest.processors.forEach((proc) => {
  if (proc.output && !fs.existsSync(proc.output)) {
    console.error(`Missing: ${proc.output}`)
  }
})
```

#### C. Enhanced Pipeline Logging

- Log actual file paths created
- Log any path substitutions
- Log decision to reuse existing files

## Specific Files to Examine

1. **processor-run-20250809-122909.log** - Full processor execution log
2. **processor-manifest-vs2.json** - What was requested
3. **invoke-processor.sh** - How processors are called
4. **run-processor-pipeline.sh** - How the pipeline works

## Deliverables Needed

1. **Root Cause**: Why did processors report success without creating expected files?
2. **File Mapping**: Document actual files created vs expected
3. **Prevention Code**: Scripts to validate processor outputs
4. **Updated Pipeline**: Modified to fail fast on missing outputs

## Success Criteria

- Never again have processors report success without creating promised files
- Clear error messages when processors can't create files
- Validation that runs automatically after each processor
- Trust but VERIFY becomes the pipeline motto

Please investigate and create:

1. A detailed findings report
2. Scripts to prevent this in the future
3. Recommendations for pipeline improvements
