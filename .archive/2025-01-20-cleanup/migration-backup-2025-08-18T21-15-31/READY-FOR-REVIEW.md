# üõë READY FOR THREE-WAY REVIEW

## Current Status

We have **STOPPED** implementation and set up the specification structure for a proper three-way review.

## What We've Created

### 1. **Specification Structure** (`/specs/`)
- Technical specifications for HOW the pipeline works
- Processor contracts and interfaces
- Validation criteria
- Located at: `.pipeline/specs/SPEC-STRUCTURE.md`

### 2. **Requirements Structure** (`/requirements/`)
- Business requirements for WHAT the factory produces
- Quality standards and acceptance criteria
- Success metrics
- Located at: `.pipeline/requirements/README.md`

### 3. **Review Process** (`/specs/review/`)
- Template for three-way reviews
- Sign-off process
- Located at: `.pipeline/specs/review/REVIEW-TEMPLATE.md`

## üéØ What We Need to Define Together

### Critical Questions Requiring Three-Way Agreement:

#### 1. **Visual Fidelity**
- How closely must the output match the concept visually?
- Is pixel-perfect required or is "functionally equivalent" enough?
- What deviations are acceptable?

#### 2. **Functional Parity**
- Must every feature work EXACTLY like the concept?
- Can we enhance functionality in prototype/production?
- What constitutes "working correctly"?

#### 3. **Success Criteria**
- When do we consider a transformation successful?
- How do we measure success?
- Who validates the output?

#### 4. **Pipeline Architecture**
- Should processors be more granular or more integrated?
- How should processors validate their output?
- What happens when validation fails?

#### 5. **Factory Outputs**
- What types of applications should the factory handle?
- Single-page apps only? Multi-page? 
- What frameworks should we support?

## üìã Next Steps

### Step 1: Requirements Gathering Session
**Participants**: User + Claude (via User)
**Goal**: Define WHAT we're building
**Output**: Completed requirements documents

### Step 2: Technical Review
**Participants**: CC + Claude (via User)
**Goal**: Define HOW we'll build it
**Output**: Technical specifications

### Step 3: Validation Review
**Participants**: All three
**Goal**: Agree on success criteria
**Output**: Test cases and acceptance criteria

## ü§î Key Learning from First Attempt

The generated app didn't match the concept because:
1. **No visual validation** - We never checked if output looked right
2. **No functional testing** - We never verified behavior matched
3. **Assumed success** - "No errors" ‚â† "Works correctly"
4. **Lost fidelity** - Each transformation lost information

## üí° Proposed Improvements

1. **Visual regression testing** - Screenshot comparison
2. **Functional test generation** - From concept behavior
3. **Incremental validation** - Check at each step
4. **Fidelity preservation** - Maintain concept integrity

## ‚è∏Ô∏è WAITING FOR INPUT

**We are ready for the three-way review session.**

No more building until we agree on:
- What success looks like
- How we measure it
- Who validates it

**User**: Ready to begin the requirements session when you are.
**Claude**: Please relay architectural requirements through User.
**CC**: Standing by for implementation after requirements are clear.
