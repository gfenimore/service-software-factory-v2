# Business Requirements for Software Factory

## 📂 Directory Purpose

This directory contains the BUSINESS requirements that define:
- **WHAT** the factory should produce
- **WHO** will use the factory outputs  
- **WHY** we need this factory
- **WHEN** outputs are considered successful
- **WHERE** outputs will be deployed

## 📁 Proposed Structure

## 🎯 Key Questions to Answer

### Business Level
1. What types of applications should the factory produce?
2. Who are the end users of these applications?
3. What business value does automation provide?
4. What manual effort are we eliminating?

### Functional Level
1. What must the factory be able to do?
2. What inputs does it accept?
3. What outputs must it produce?
4. What quality standards must be met?

### Quality Level
1. How much can the output deviate from the concept?
2. What code quality standards are required?
3. What performance benchmarks must be met?
4. What accessibility standards apply?

### Acceptance Level
1. How do we know the factory succeeded?
2. What tests validate success?
3. What metrics do we track?
4. Who approves the output?

## ⏸️ AWAITING INPUT

We need a three-way requirements session to define:

### From USER (Business Owner):
- Vision and goals
- Types of applications needed
- Quality expectations
- Success criteria

### From CLAUDE (Architect):
- Technical standards
- Architectural patterns
- Best practices
- Quality gates

### From CC (Implementation):
- Feasibility assessment
- Technical approach
- Validation methods
- Testing strategy

**STATUS**: Structure ready, awaiting requirements gathering session
