## 2. Problem Statement & Business Case

### 2.1 Current State Problems

**Death by a Thousand Cuts**
Traditional applications are built as direct implementations of data models, forcing users into entity-by-entity list/detail views. To answer a simple customer question like "What's happening with my account?", users must:

- Navigate to Accounts module → find account
- Navigate to Locations module → filter by account → view each location
- Navigate to Work Orders module → filter by location → check status
- Navigate to Contacts module → find related contacts
- **Result**: 8-12 clicks and 2-3 minutes for basic information

### 2.2 Quantified Business Impact

- **Productivity Loss**: 20-30% of staff time wasted on navigation
- **Support Calls**: Average resolution time of 5-10 minutes
- **Scaling Crisis**: As business grows, service quality degrades
- **Hidden Costs**:
  - 100 accounts × 5 daily checks × 3 minutes = 25 hours/week lost
  - Support team fielding calls they can't answer quickly
  - Technicians calling office for information they can't access

### 2.3 Future State Vision

Users see everything about an account instantly:

- All service locations at a glance
- Active work orders with status
- Recent activity and upcoming scheduled work
- Contact information and service agreements
- **Result**: <15 seconds to complete account picture

## 3. Business Objects & Relationships

### 3.1 Core Business Objects

**ACCOUNT** (Primary Entity)

- Represents: Customer organization or individual
- Key Attributes: Name, Type, Status, Billing Address
- Lifecycle: Prospect → Active → Suspended → Inactive → Archived
- Business Rules:
  - Must have at least one service location to be Active
  - Cannot be deleted if has transaction history
  - Status changes trigger notification workflows

**SERVICE_LOCATION** (Dependent Entity)

- Represents: Physical location receiving service
- Key Attributes: Address, Access Info, Service Schedule
- Lifecycle: Pending → Active → On-Hold → Inactive
- Business Rules:
  - Inherits billing from parent Account
  - Can have location-specific contacts
  - Must be accessible for service delivery

**WORK_ORDER** (Transactional Entity)

- Represents: Service delivery instance
- Key Attributes: Type, Status, Schedule, Priority, Technician
- Lifecycle: Scheduled → Assigned → In-Progress → Completed → Invoiced
- Business Rules:
  - Must be linked to active Service Location
  - Priority determines scheduling sequence
  - Completion triggers billing processes

### 3.2 Object Relationships

```
ACCOUNT (1) ─────→ (N) SERVICE_LOCATION
                            │
                            ↓
                       (N) WORK_ORDER
```

### 4.3 User Workflows

**Customer Inquiry Workflow**

1. Customer calls: "What's the status of my service?"
2. User searches account name (Column 1)
3. Sees all locations instantly (Column 2)
4. Views recent/upcoming work orders (Column 3)
5. **Answer provided in <15 seconds**

**Technician Support Workflow**

1. Tech calls: "What am I supposed to do at 123 Main St?"
2. User finds account → location → work order
3. Sees complete work order details and history
4. **Tech has answer within 30 seconds**

**Account Review Workflow**

1. Owner wants complete picture of key account
