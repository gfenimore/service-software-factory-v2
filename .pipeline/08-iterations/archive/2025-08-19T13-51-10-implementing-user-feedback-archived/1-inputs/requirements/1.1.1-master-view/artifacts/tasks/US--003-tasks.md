- Status color coding clarity and accessibility

## Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies:
- **US--002** (Locations Column): Must be complete for location selection
- **US--001** (Accounts Column): Indirect dependency through location selection
- Event bus system must handle work order events
- Mock work order data must link to location data

### Integrates With:
- **US--002** (Locations): Receives location selection events
- **US--004** (Integrated Actions): Provides data for bulk operations
- **Future Detail View**: Work order selection event consumer
- **Future Work Order Management**: Status update integration

## Mock Data Specifications

### Work Order Data Structure:
```javascript
{
  id: "wo_001",
  locationId: "loc_001",
  type: "HVAC Maintenance",
  description: "Quarterly HVAC system inspection and filter replacement",
  status: "scheduled", // pending, scheduled, in-progress, completed, cancelled
  priority: "normal", // low, normal, high, urgent
  scheduledDateTime: "2024-01-15T14:00:00Z",
  estimatedDuration: 120, // minutes
  assignedTechnician: "John Smith",
  createdDate: "2024-01-10T09:00:00Z",
  notes: "Customer prefers afternoon appointments"
}
```

### Status Distribution Guidelines:
- Pending: 30% (newly created, awaiting scheduling)
- Scheduled: 35% (assigned time and technician)
- In-progress: 20% (currently being worked on)
- Completed: 10% (finished work orders, recent)
- Cancelled: 5% (cancelled for various reasons)

### Priority Distribution:
- Low: 20%
- Normal: 60%
- High: 15%
- Urgent: 5%

## Status Color Accessibility

All status colors must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements and include non-color indicators:
- Text labels alongside colors
- Icons (ðŸ”§ for active, âœ“ for completed)
- Pattern/texture options for colorblind users
- High contrast mode support

## Notes

- Final column in navigation hierarchy - culmination of Master View workflow
- Primary destination for most user tasks
- Status updates are critical functionality requiring reliability
- Performance is essential for user productivity
- Must handle real-time updates from other users (future)
- Color accessibility is mandatory for status indicators
- Console.log for all interactions in Concept Line implementation
- Preparation for bulk operations without over-engineering
