## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Concept Line)
- Console.log verification for all bulk operations
- Manual testing of selection state management
- Visual verification of drag-and-drop operations
- Performance testing with maximum selection counts

### Integration Testing
- Test bulk operations with all three core columns
- Verify event bus integration
- Test undo functionality thoroughly
- Validate cross-column selection coordination

### User Acceptance Testing
- Bulk operations should be 5x faster than individual actions
- Drag-and-drop should be intuitive without training
- No data loss during any bulk operation
- Undo functionality should work reliably

## Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies:
- **US-111-001, US-111-002, US-111-003**: All three core columns must be complete
- Event bus system must support bulk operation events
- Selection state management system must be implemented
- Mock data relationships must be properly established

### Integrates With:
- **All Three Columns**: Provides bulk operation capabilities
- **Future Detail View**: Bulk selections can trigger detail views
- **Future Work Order Management**: Bulk operations flow to work order system
- **Future Assignment System**: Bulk technician assignments

## Mock Data Considerations

### Bulk Operation Simulation:
```javascript
// Example bulk operation logging
console.log('Bulk Status Update:', {
  operation: 'statusUpdate',
  newStatus: 'completed',
  workOrderIds: ['wo_001', 'wo_002', 'wo_003'],
  affectedCount: 3,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

### Undo Operation Tracking:
```javascript
// Example undo operation structure
{
  operationId: 'bulk_001',
  type: 'bulkStatusUpdate',
  originalData: [...], // Previous state
  newData: [...], // Current state
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  canUndo: true,
  undoDescription: 'Undo status update for 3 work orders'
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Selection Performance:
- Maximum 100 items selected simultaneously
- Selection state updates < 50ms
- Drag-and-drop smooth at 60fps
- Bulk operation UI response < 200ms

### Memory Management:
- Clean up event listeners for removed selections
- Limit undo operation retention (15 minutes)
- Efficient DOM updates for large selections
- Optimize re-rendering with selection changes

## Accessibility Requirements

### Selection Accessibility:
- Screen reader announcements for selection changes
- Keyboard navigation for all selection operations
- High contrast selection indicators
- Focus management during bulk operations

### Drag-and-Drop Accessibility:
- Keyboard alternatives for all drag operations
- Screen reader feedback for drag state
- Clear instructions for keyboard-only users
- Focus trapping during drag operations

## Notes

- **Implementation Priority**: Only implement after core columns are validated
- Advanced feature requiring careful UX design
- Significant efficiency gains for power users
- Performance testing critical with large datasets
- Undo functionality essential for user confidence
- Console.log for all interactions in Concept Line implementation
- Avoid over-engineering - keep simple for Concept Line
- Focus on proving the UX patterns work before adding complexity
