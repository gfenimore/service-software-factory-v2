# 📍 WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW
**Date**: 2025-08-18  
**Current Focus**: Fresh concept line run starting at sub-module level

## 🎯 What We're About To Do

**Start fresh concept line development of Master View (1.1.1) sub-module**

Remember: 
- We decided to "step back from all the code, except the sidebar navigation"
- Start with a clean slate using our new progressive factory
- Build complete sub-modules (not isolated components)

## 📁 Suggested Naming Convention

### For Requirements Documents
```
Pattern: {HierarchyID}-{Level}-{Name}.md

Examples:
1.0-APP-pest-control-vision.md
1.1-MOD-account-management.md  
1.1.1-SUB-master-view.md
1.1.1.1-STORY-US006-service-locations.md
```

### For Concept Line Artifacts
```
Pattern: {HierarchyID}-{Name}-CONCEPT.{ext}

Examples:
1.1.1-master-view-CONCEPT.tsx
1.1.1-master-view-CONCEPT.test.js
1.1.1-interface-CONCEPT.ts
```

### For Progressive Artifacts
```
Concept:    1.1.1-master-view-CONCEPT.tsx
Prototype:  1.1.1-master-view-PROTO.tsx
Production: 1.1.1-master-view-PROD.tsx
```

## 🚀 Ready to Start Fresh Run!

### Step 1: Archive existing code (except navigation)
```bash
mkdir -p .archive/pre-hierarchy
mv src/app/* .archive/pre-hierarchy/
# Then restore just navigation
```

### Step 2: Create concept line structure
```
.pipeline/concept/
├── 1.1.1-master-view/
│   ├── index-CONCEPT.html
│   ├── app-CONCEPT.tsx
│   ├── mock-data-CONCEPT.js
│   └── interface-CONCEPT.ts
├── 1.1.2-detail-view/
└── 1.2.1-work-orders/
```

### Step 3: Build Master View in concept
- Start with plain HTML/CSS
- Add mock data
- Use console.log for everything
- any types everywhere
- Get it WORKING first!

## 📊 Current Inventory

### What We've Built (Infrastructure)
✅ Requirements hierarchy (1.0 → 1.1 → 1.1.1 → 1.1.1.1)
✅ Progressive factory configuration
✅ Contract Registry system
✅ Interface contracts for sub-modules
✅ Progressive mapping (concept → prototype → production)

### What We're Building (Code)
🔄 1.1.1 Master View (concept line)
⏳ 1.1.2 Detail View (waiting)
⏳ 1.2.1 Work Order Management (waiting)

### What We're Keeping
✅ Sidebar navigation (the ONLY surviving code)
❌ Everything else gets archived

## 💡 Quick Wins for Fresh Start

1. **Create a simple HTML file** for Master View concept
2. **Use inline everything** - styles, scripts, data
3. **Console.log liberally** - show every interaction
4. **Mock 50 accounts** with fun pest control names
5. **Get clicking working** between columns
6. **Show it works** before adding ANY complexity

Want me to:
1. Archive the existing code (except navigation)?
2. Create the fresh 1.1.1-master-view-CONCEPT.html to start?
3. Generate mock pest control data?

Just say "GO!" and I'll start the fresh concept run! 🚀
