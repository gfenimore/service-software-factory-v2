# User Story US-111-004: Integrated Actions

**Story ID**: US-111-004  
**Sub-Module**: 1.1.1 Master View  
**Original ID**: US-010  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Ready for Development (Planned)  

## Story Description
As a service technician/dispatcher, I want to perform bulk operations and integrated actions across the three-column Master View so that I can efficiently manage multiple accounts, locations, and work orders simultaneously without switching between different interfaces.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Cross-Column Bulk Operations
- [ ] Select multiple items across different columns (accounts, locations, work orders)
- [ ] Support Shift+click for range selection and Ctrl+click for individual selection
- [ ] Display bulk selection indicator with count of selected items
- [ ] Enable bulk status updates for selected work orders
- [ ] Support bulk assignment of technicians to work orders
- [ ] Bulk scheduling operations for multiple work orders

### Drag-and-Drop Functionality
- [ ] Drag work orders between different locations for rescheduling
- [ ] Drag technicians/resources onto work orders for assignment
- [ ] Visual feedback during drag operations with drop zones
- [ ] Prevent invalid drop operations with clear visual feedback
- [ ] Auto-save changes after successful drag-and-drop

### Quick-Create Actions
- [ ] Create new work order from any column with context pre-filled
- [ ] Add new service location to selected account
- [ ] Create follow-up work orders from existing ones
- [ ] Quick-create from right-click context menus
- [ ] Modal/inline forms with smart defaults based on selection context

### Context-Aware Actions
- [ ] Right-click context menus adapt based on selection type and count
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for common bulk operations
- [ ] Smart action suggestions based on selected items
- [ ] Batch operations confirmation dialogs with preview
- [ ] Undo functionality for bulk operations

### Visual Requirements
- [ ] Clear visual indicators for selected items across columns
- [ ] Consistent selection styling across all three columns
- [ ] Bulk action toolbar appears when multiple items selected
- [ ] Drag indicators and drop zones with clear visual feedback
- [ ] Progress indicators for long-running bulk operations

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Bulk operations UI response < 200ms
- [ ] Drag-and-drop smooth at 60 fps
- [ ] Handle selection of up to 100 items efficiently
- [ ] Background processing for large bulk operations
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates with rollback capability

### Validation Criteria (Future Implementation)
- [ ] Users can perform bulk operations 5x faster than individual actions
- [ ] Drag-and-drop operations are intuitive without training
- [ ] No data loss during bulk operations
- [ ] Undo functionality works reliably

## Technical Specifications

### Data Requirements
```yaml
BulkOperations:
  maxSelectionCount: 100
  supportedOperations:
    - statusUpdate
    - technicianAssignment
    - rescheduling
    - bulkCreate
  undoRetentionMinutes: 15
```

### Interface Contract
**Events Provided:**
- `bulk:selected` - Emitted when bulk selection changes
  - Payload: `BulkSelectionEvent`
- `bulk:operation:started` - Emitted when bulk operation begins
- `bulk:operation:completed` - Emitted when bulk operation finishes
- `drag:started` - Emitted when drag operation starts
- `drag:completed` - Emitted when drop operation completes

**Events Consumed:**
- `workOrder:updated` - Updates bulk selection if affected
- `account:created` - Updates available drop targets
- `location:created` - Updates available drop targets

**State Exposed:**
```typescript
bulkSelection: {
  accounts: Account[],
  locations: Location[],
  workOrders: WorkOrder[]
}
dragState: {
  isDragging: boolean,
  dragType: 'workOrder' | 'technician' | null,
  dragData: any
}
```

### API Dependencies
- Bulk operations API (POST /bulk-operations)
- Work Order updates API (PATCH /work-orders/bulk)
- Assignment API (POST /assignments/bulk)
- Undo operations API (POST /undo/{operationId})

### Complex State Management
- Track selection state across all three columns
- Maintain drag-and-drop state during operations
- Handle concurrent updates during bulk operations
- Optimistic updates with conflict resolution

## Development Notes

### Implementation Priority
This story is marked as "Planned" and should be implemented after the three core columns (US-111-001, US-111-002, US-111-003) are complete and validated.

### Concept Line Implementation (Future)
- Simple bulk selection with console.log
- Basic drag-and-drop without data persistence
- Mock operations with simulated delays
- No error handling or undo functionality

### Progressive Enhancement
- **Prototype Line**: Real bulk operations with proper API integration
- **Production Line**: Comprehensive undo system, conflict resolution

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Bulk operations work reliably with real data
- [ ] Drag-and-drop operations are smooth and intuitive
- [ ] Performance targets achieved under load
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling implemented
- [ ] Undo functionality tested thoroughly
- [ ] User acceptance testing passed
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Integration with all three columns functional

## Integration Points
- **With All Three Columns**: Provides bulk operation capabilities
- **With Detail View (1.1.2)**: Bulk selections can open in detail view
- **With Work Order Management (1.2.1)**: Bulk operations flow to work order system
- **With Assignment System**: Bulk technician assignments

## Edge Cases and Considerations
- Bulk operations on items from different accounts/locations
- Concurrent modifications during bulk operations
- Network failures during long-running bulk operations
- Permission checks for bulk operations
- Validation of drag-and-drop operations across different contexts
- Large selection sets (100+ items)
- Undo operations on partially failed bulk operations

## User Experience Considerations
- Clear feedback for all bulk operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Graceful degradation when features unavailable
- Keyboard accessibility for all bulk operations
- Touch-friendly interaction on tablets

## Notes
- This is an advanced feature that builds on the three core columns
- Should not be implemented until core navigation is proven
- Represents significant efficiency gains for power users
- Requires careful UX design to avoid complexity
- Performance testing critical with large datasets
- Undo functionality is essential for user confidence
