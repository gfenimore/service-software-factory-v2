# Requirements Hierarchy Validation
**Created**: 2025-08-18  
**Status**: âœ… VALIDATED

## Key Questions Answered at Each Level

### 1.0 Application Level
**Question**: What business are we transforming?  
**Answer**: Pest Control Service Management - from paper-based to digital-first operations  
**Artifact**: `1.0-application/pest-control-vision.md` âœ…

### 1.1 Module Level  
**Question**: What capabilities do we need?  
**Answer**: Account Management - complete customer lifecycle from contact to billing  
**Artifact**: `1.1-modules/account-management/module-definition.md` âœ…

### 1.1.1 Sub-Module Level
**Question**: How do users experience this capability?  
**Answer**: Three-column Master View for rapid navigation and context preservation  
**Artifact**: `1.1.1-sub-modules/master-view/feature-definition.md` âœ…

### 1.1.1.1 Story Level
**Question**: What specific functionality are we building?  
**Answer Examples**:
- US-004: Accounts column with search/filter
- US-006: Service locations column with status indicators  
- US-008: Work orders column with quick actions
**Artifacts**: `1.1.1.1-stories/US-XXX-*.md` âœ…

### 1.1.1.1.1 Task Level
**Question**: What code do we write?  
**Answer Examples**:
- Build AccountCard component
- Implement location filtering logic
- Add work order status updates
**Location**: Code in `.pipeline/{concept|prototype|production}/`

## The Revolutionary Formula

```
Requirements Hierarchy (Business Clarity)
    +
Progressive Standards (Technical Evolution)
    +
Sub-Module Thinking (Atomic Promotion Units)
    =
RADICAL SIMPLICITY AT EACH STAGE
```

## Validation Checklist

### Business Alignment âœ…
- [x] Application vision drives all decisions
- [x] Modules map to business capabilities
- [x] Sub-modules represent user experiences
- [x] Stories deliver specific value
- [x] Tasks produce working code

### Progressive Development âœ…
- [x] Concept: Validates workflows with any/console.log
- [x] Prototype: Integrates with TypeScript/APIs
- [x] Production: Hardens with Zod/monitoring

### Sub-Module Coherence âœ…
- [x] Master View promoted as complete unit
- [x] Interface contracts define boundaries
- [x] Event-driven communication between sub-modules
- [x] Contract Registry visualizes relationships

### Traceability âœ…
- [x] Every task traces to application vision
- [x] Hierarchy IDs in all artifacts (1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.)
- [x] Progressive mapping tracks promotion status
- [x] Clear dependencies between sub-modules

## Current State

```yaml
Application (1.0):
  Status: Vision Defined âœ…
  
Account Management (1.1):
  Status: In Development
  Sub-Modules:
    Master View (1.1.1): 
      Line: Concept
      Stories: 4 (2 in-progress, 2 planned)
    Detail View (1.1.2):
      Line: Concept  
      Stories: 3 (planned)
    Reports (1.1.3):
      Line: Not Started
      
Operations (1.2):
  Status: Planned
  Sub-Modules:
    Work Order Mgmt (1.2.1):
      Line: Concept
      Interface: Defined âœ…
```

## The Power of This Approach

1. **Business First**: Requirements hierarchy keeps us grounded in business value
2. **Progressive Refinement**: Each line has appropriate standards
3. **Atomic Promotion**: Sub-modules move as complete, tested units
4. **Clear Communication**: Interface contracts enable parallel development
5. **Radical Simplicity**: Complex only becomes complex in production

## Next Steps

1. Complete Master View stories in concept line
2. Validate with stakeholders
3. Promote entire 1.1.1 sub-module to prototype
4. Begin Detail View (1.1.2) in concept while 1.1.1 hardens

**CONFIRMED**: The hierarchy perfectly answers each level's key question, creating a revolutionary approach to building complex applications with radical simplicity at each stage.

**We are GOOD to proceed!** ðŸš€
