## 📋 Key Documents to Create (BUT NOT YET)

### 1. Pipeline Specifications (HOW)
- **Pipeline Architecture** - Overall system design
- **Processor Contracts** - How processors communicate
- **Data Flow** - How data moves through pipeline
- **Validation Criteria** - How we know it worked

### 2. Business Requirements (WHAT)
- **Factory Outputs** - What types of apps we build
- **Quality Standards** - What level of quality we ensure
- **User Stories** - Who uses this and why
- **Success Metrics** - How we measure factory success

### 3. Review Process (WHO)
- **Three-way review** involving:
  - User (business owner)
  - CC (implementation)
  - Claude (architecture)

## 🎯 Goals for Spec Documents

1. **Clear Contracts** - Every processor knows its inputs/outputs
2. **Measurable Success** - We can verify the output matches requirements
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - Each line adds specific value
4. **Visual & Functional Fidelity** - Output matches concept

## ⏸️ WAITING FOR REVIEW

Before we build anything, we need:
1. User to define business requirements
2. Claude to define architectural requirements
3. CC to define implementation approach
4. All three to agree on success criteria

## Questions for Review Session

### For User:
- What constitutes a successful transformation?
- What visual/functional fidelity is required?
- What types of applications should the factory handle?

### For Claude:
- What architectural patterns should we enforce?
- How should processors validate their work?
- What intermediate formats work best?

### For CC:
- How do we test visual fidelity?
- How do we ensure functional parity?
- How do we validate at each step?

**STATUS**: Structure proposed, awaiting three-way review before implementation
