# Pipeline Structure Migration Log

**Date**: 2025-08-18T21:15:51.557Z
**Backup Location**: migration-backup-2025-08-18T21-15-31

## Summary

Successfully migrated from the old sprawling structure to a clean numbered (1-5) structure.

## New Structure

```
.pipeline/
├── 1-inputs/          # Starting points (requirements, specs, config)
├── 2-factory/         # The machinery (agents, processors, validation)
├── 3-workspace/       # Active work in progress
├── 4-outputs/         # Completed, validated outputs
├── 5-archive/         # Historical runs
└── docs/              # Documentation
```

## Key Features

1. **Sequential numbering** (1-5) shows the flow through the pipeline
2. **Clear separation** between inputs, machinery, work, and outputs
3. **Single workspace** for all active work (easy to clean)
4. **Validation folder** added to factory per Claude's suggestion
5. **Documentation** moved to dedicated docs/ folder

## Migrations Performed

| From | To | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| requirements | 1-inputs/requirements | Business requirements and generated artifacts |
| config | 1-inputs/config | Pipeline configuration files |
| factory/agents | 2-factory/agents | Agent definitions |
| factory/processors | 2-factory/processors | Processor definitions |
| factory/transformers | 2-factory/processors/transformers | Transformation processors |
| concept | 3-workspace/concept | Active concept work |
| prototype | 3-workspace/prototype | Active prototype work |
| production | 3-workspace/production | Active production work |
| current | 3-workspace/current | Current work in progress |
| runs | 3-workspace/runs | Recent pipeline runs |
| graduated | 4-outputs | Graduated/completed outputs |
| archive | 5-archive | Historical runs and artifacts |
| specs | docs/architecture | Technical specifications |

## Files Updated

3 files had their references updated:
- 2-factory\orchestration\executor.js
- 2-factory\orchestration\run-complete-pipeline.js
- 2-factory\orchestration\run-pipeline.js

## Next Steps

1. Test all processors to ensure they work with new paths
2. Update any manual documentation that references old paths
3. Create initial requirements in 1-inputs/requirements/1.1.1-master-view/

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback this migration:
1. Delete the new numbered directories (1-inputs, 2-factory, etc.)
2. Copy everything from migration-backup-2025-08-18T21-15-31 back to .pipeline/
3. Remove MIGRATION-LOG.md

## Notes

- Added `2-factory/validation/` folder for validation processors
- Test outputs and temporary files were deleted (not migrated)
- Empty directories from old structure were removed
- All file references in JS/MD files were updated automatically
