### Active Work Areas
| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Concept Line | Planning Complete | Ready for implementation |
| App Shell | Designed | Pre-built template approach |
| Rule Collection UI | PRD Written | Needs implementation |
| Stage Orchestrator | Not Started | Critical missing piece |

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Tools/Systems Identified
1. **Existing Tools Ready**
   - BUSM Reader: `.pipeline/01-concept-line/tools/busm-reader/`
   - Business Rules Configurator: `.pipeline/01-concept-line/tools/business-rules-configurator/`
   - Module System: `.pipeline/04-processing-tools/module-system/`
   - ViewForge: `.pipeline/01-concept-line/tools/viewforge/`
   - AST Generator: `.pipeline/04-processing-tools/ast-generator/`
   - Gap Logger: `.pipeline/04-processing-tools/gap-logger/`

2. **Tools Needing Creation**
   - Rule Collection UI (PRD complete)
   - Stage Orchestrator
   - BUSM Mermaid Parser (currently using JSON)

### New Dependencies/Requirements
- [x] BUSM in Mermaid format (`.pipeline/00-requirements/models/BUSM.mmd`)
- [x] Feature specifications from Product Owner
- [ ] Pre-built app shell template
- [ ] Stage orchestration script

### Known Issues/Gaps
1. **Issue**: No automated orchestration between stages
   - **Impact**: High
   - **Suggested Fix**: Create pipeline orchestrator script

2. **Issue**: BUSM Reader expects JSON, we have Mermaid
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Suggested Fix**: Add Mermaid parser to BUSM Reader

3. **Issue**: No Rule Collection UI
   - **Impact**: High
   - **Suggested Fix**: Build based on PRD created today

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next Session - FRESH START)
1. **Create Stage 0 App Shell Template** - 2 hours
   - Context: Foundation for all components
   - Location: `.pipeline/06-control-panel/app-shell/`
   - Dependencies: React, React Router, Material UI

2. **Build Pipeline Orchestrator** - 3 hours
   - Context: Automate Stage 1-6 execution
   - Location: `.pipeline/01-concept-line/orchestrator/`
   - Dependencies: All factory tools

3. **Implement BUSM Mermaid Parser** - 1 hour
   - Context: Parse `.mmd` files instead of JSON
   - Location: `.pipeline/01-concept-line/tools/busm-reader/`
   - Dependencies: Mermaid parser library

4. **Create Rule Collection UI** - 4 hours
   - Context: Web UI for business rule definition
   - Location: `.pipeline/01-concept-line/tools/business-rules-configurator/rule-collection-ui/`
   - Dependencies: Express, HTML/JS frontend

### Upcoming Milestones
- [ ] First automated Concept Line run - Target: Next session
- [ ] Master View POC generation - Target: Next session + 1
- [ ] Stakeholder review ready - Target: Next session + 2

## 📝 Important Notes

### Decisions Made
- **Decision**: Use pre-built app shell instead of generated
  - **Rationale**: Faster, more reliable, incremental growth
  - **Alternatives Considered**: Full generation (too complex initially)

- **Decision**: Start with minimal shell (just Accounts/Master View)
  - **Rationale**: Incremental approach, prove concept first
  - **Alternatives Considered**: Full navigation structure (overwhelming)

- **Decision**: Add Rule Collection UI to Stage 1
  - **Rationale**: Non-technical stakeholders need UI, not CLI
  - **Alternatives Considered**: Keep CLI only (too technical)

### Architectural Insights
- Stage 0 (App Shell) should be one-time setup, not per-iteration
- Business Rules Configurator is the behavior layer (BUSM is structure)
- Integration indicators are critical for stakeholder review
- ViewForge needs card pattern support for Master View
- AST guarantees syntactic correctness - key differentiator

### Process Improvements
- Parse feature specs with story-builder to extract entities
- Use BUSM subset extraction (only needed entities, not all)
- Embed indicators (📌 rules, 🔗 integrations, ⚠️ gaps) in UI

## 🔗 References

### Key Files Created
- `.pipeline/concept-line/STAGE-1-REQUIREMENTS-CAPTURE.md` - Detailed Stage 1 process (NOTE: Created in wrong location)
- `.pipeline/factory-tools/business-rules-configurator/RULE-COLLECTION-UI-PRD.md` - UI specification (NOTE: Created in wrong location)

### Documentation Updated
- Concept Line flow diagram reviewed and refined
- Stage inputs/outputs clearly defined

### External Resources
- BUSM source: `.pipeline/00-requirements/models/BUSM.mmd`
- Feature spec: `.product-specs/00-platform-core/epics/EP-001-accounts/features/FEA-001-master-view/master-view-feature.md`

## ⚠️ Warnings/Caveats

### Don't Touch
- `.pipeline/06-control-panel/` - Working Control Panel, serves on port 3000

### For Fresh Start
- DO NOT reuse any generated artifacts from this session
- Start with clean `.pipeline/stage*/` directories
- Create new handoff for implementation session

## 💡 Learnings & Insights

### What Worked Well
- Breaking down stages into clear input/output artifacts
- Using existing tools (story-builder, BUSM reader, etc.)
- Three-column Master View maps well to ViewForge

### Key Insights
- Product Owner provides just 2 artifacts: BUSM + Feature Spec
- Everything else is derived/generated
- Clickable POC includes business indicators for review
- Manifest handoff to Prototype Line is comprehensive

### Recommendations
- Build orchestrator FIRST to connect all tools
- Implement Rule Collection UI for better stakeholder engagement
- Consider recording demo video of complete pipeline run

## 📋 Checklist for Next Session

### Pre-Start Checks
- [ ] Start FRESH - no artifact reuse
- [ ] Clear all `.pipeline/01-concept-line/outputs/` directories
- [ ] Review this handoff document
- [ ] Have BUSM.mmd and master-view-feature.md ready

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Current directory: `C:\Users\GarryFenimore\Projects\service-software-factory-v2`

### First Commands
```bash
# Start fresh
rm -rf .pipeline/01-concept-line/outputs/*
mkdir -p .pipeline/01-concept-line/outputs/stage{1..6}

# Verify tools exist
ls .pipeline/01-concept-line/tools/
ls .pipeline/04-processing-tools/

# Check source artifacts
ls .pipeline/00-requirements/models/
cat .product-specs/00-platform-core/epics/EP-001-accounts/features/FEA-001-master-view/master-view-feature.md
