4. **Code Manager Standalone**
   - Location: `scripts/code-manager.js`
   - Changes: MCP agent alternative with npm scripts integration
   - Status: **Working** - `npm run code:status` provides project context

### New Dependencies/Requirements
- **Node.js >= 14.0.0** (already met)
- **Pipeline input files** (already exist):
  - `.pipeline/00-requirements/models/BUSM.mmd` ✅
  - `.product-specs/.../master-view-feature.md` ✅

### Known Issues/Bugs
1. **Issue**: Fantasy vs Reality Documentation Gap
   - **Location**: `stage2-sequence-viewer.html` (old complex version)
   - **Impact**: Medium - Confusing documentation
   - **Suggested Fix**: Use `stage2-simple-sequence-viewer.html` instead

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next Session)
1. **Stage 2 Step-by-Step Validation** - 30 minutes
   - Context: Validate the simple 24-line Stage 2 implementation
   - Location: `cd .pipeline/01-concept-line/orchestrator && node stage-runner.js 1 2`
   - Dependencies: Stage 1 outputs (already working)

2. **Stage 3-6 Sequential Testing** - 60 minutes
   - Context: Test each remaining stage individually and understand outputs
   - Location: Same orchestrator directory
   - Dependencies: Understanding of ViewForge, AST Generation, Validation, Deployment

3. **Discovery Canvas → Pipeline Integration Testing** - 45 minutes
   - Context: Test complete workflow from discovery document to running POC
   - Location: Start with discovery canvas, create user stories, run pipeline
   - Dependencies: Understanding of how discovery feeds feature specs

### Upcoming Milestones
- [ ] **Complete Pipeline Validation** - Target: Next session
- [ ] **Discovery-to-Pipeline Workflow Documentation** - Target: Next session
- [ ] **Stage-by-stage Testing Documentation** - Target: Next session

## 📝 Important Notes

### Decisions Made
- **Decision**: Use incremental stage-by-stage testing approach
  - **Rationale**: "We will fail if I do not understand everything that is happening"
  - **Alternatives Considered**: Continue with full pipeline execution (rejected - too complex)

- **Decision**: SIMPLE implementations are better than complex ones
  - **Rationale**: Stage 2 works perfectly with 24 lines vs fantasy complex version
  - **Alternatives Considered**: Build complex Stage 2 (rejected - unnecessary)

### Architectural Changes
- **Incremental Testing Framework**: Added ability to run individual stages 1-6
- **Reality-Based Documentation**: Sequence diagrams now match actual code
- **Discovery Integration Clarity**: Established clear path from Canvas → Stories → Specs → Pipeline

### Process Improvements
- **Step-by-step validation**: Every pipeline step now has detailed logging
- **Reset capability**: Can clean outputs and rerun any stage combination
- **Documentation accuracy**: Viewers now show actual vs theoretical implementations

### Key Files to Review (Next Session)
- `.pipeline/01-concept-line/orchestrator/stage-runner.js` - **CRITICAL** - Your new testing tool
- `.pipeline/01-concept-line/outputs/stage1/` - **VALIDATE** - Stage 1 outputs to examine
- `.pipeline/01-concept-line/models/system-flows/stage2-simple-sequence-viewer.html` - Stage 2 reality
- `PIPELINE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - **CONTEXT** - Overall pipeline restructuring plan
- `FACTORY-DISCOVERY-CANVAS.md` - **CONTEXT** - Discovery framework integration

### Documentation Updated
- `sequence-viewer.html` - Updated to show complete 6-stage pipeline
- `stage2-simple-sequence-viewer.html` - New realistic Stage 2 documentation
- `HANDOFF-UPDATE-2025-08-31-CODE-MANAGER-RESOLVED.md` - Code Manager working solution

### External Resources
- Discovery Canvas methodology for requirements gathering
- Pipeline orchestrator PRD: `.pipeline/01-concept-line/orchestrator/PIPELINE-ORCHESTRATOR-PRD.md`

## ⚠️ Warnings/Caveats

### Don't Touch
- `.pipeline/01-concept-line/orchestrator/pipeline-orchestrator.js` - **Working perfectly, 500 lines of tested code**

### Needs Careful Handling
- `.pipeline/01-concept-line/models/system-flows/stage2-sequence-viewer.html` - **IGNORE** - Fantasy version
- Pipeline input paths - **VALIDATE** - Ensure BUSM.mmd and feature specs exist before testing

### Temporary Workarounds
- Using Code Manager standalone script instead of MCP agent (permanent solution - better than agent)

## 💡 Learnings & Insights

### What Worked Well
- **Incremental approach**: Step-by-step validation revealed reality vs fantasy gaps
- **Documentation validation**: Checking actual code vs documentation found major discrepancies  
- **Simple implementations**: 24-line Stage 2 works better than complex theoretical version

### What Didn't Work
- **Assuming documentation was accurate**: Old sequence viewers showed fantasy complexity
- **Full pipeline approach**: Too much happening at once to understand individual stages

### Recommendations
- **Always validate documentation against code**: Don't trust complex diagrams without testing
- **Prefer simple working solutions**: 24 lines that work > 200 lines of theory
- **Test incrementally**: Stage-by-stage understanding prevents confusion

## 🎯 **CRITICAL NEXT SESSION FOCUS**

**PRIMARY GOAL**: Continue stage-by-stage validation through Stage 6

**KEY QUESTIONS TO ANSWER**:
1. Does Stage 2 work as documented in the simple viewer?
2. What does Stage 3 ViewForge actually create?
3. Do Stages 4-6 produce the expected artifacts?
4. Can we trace a complete Discovery Canvas → POC workflow?

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: 
- All 6 stages individually tested and understood
- Complete pipeline workflow documented
- Discovery integration validated
