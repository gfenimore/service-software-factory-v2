Continue from previous thread. We just achieved a MAJOR breakthrough with automatic gap discovery in the Service Software Factory. 

**My last realization:** "LOL! This is sweet, any attribute I do NOT define, and the system thinks there should be a rule, the gap detector picks it up and marks, 'needs definition'. Is this right?"

## Current State:

### 1. What We Just Completed:
- Built complete Phase 1 Account module with Business Rules Configurator
- Integrated automatic gap discovery that finds undefined rules WITHOUT being told
- Created VisualGapLogger that embeds gap reports in ALL wireframes automatically
- System now turns wireframes into requirements discovery tools

### 2. Key Files to Know About:

**Business Rules System:**
- `.pipeline/factory-tools/business-rules-configurator/business-rules-parser.js` - YAML parser with gap detection
- `.pipeline/factory-tools/business-rules-configurator/rules-cli.js` - Interactive rule editor
- `.pipeline/factory-tools/module-system/phase1-account-basic.yaml` - Has my edits (Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Other)

**Concept Generator with Gaps:**
- `.pipeline/factory-tools/generators/concept-html/concept-generator-v3.js` - NOW has VisualGapLogger integrated!
- Every wireframe automatically shows discovered gaps

**Documentation:**
- `.pipeline/THREAD-PRESERVATION-GAP-DISCOVERY.md` - Full details of the breakthrough
- `.pipeline/factory-tools/ast-generator/AST-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md` - Next major milestone

### 3. My Context:
- Building Service Software Factory for service businesses
- Using module-based approach (Account → Account+Locations → Account+Contacts → Complete)
- Account types: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Other
- Love that the system finds gaps automatically!

### 4. Current Todo List Status:
✅ Build Business Rules YAML parser
✅ Create rules validator  
✅ Update Concept Generator to show rule hints
✅ Test with Account entity rules
✅ Create Phase 1 Account module complete system
✅ Integrate Gap Logger visual display in wireframes
⏳ Start building AST Generator foundation
⏳ Create AST-based React component generator
⏳ Build compilation verification system
⏳ Build prototype runtime environment

### 5. Next Priority:
Start building the AST Generator foundation - this will let us generate REAL React components with guaranteed valid syntax (not string concatenation).

### 6. Important Notes:
- The gap discovery is WORKING - any undefined business rule is automatically found
- Don't lose the VisualGapLogger integration in concept-generator-v3.js
- The system discovers what it doesn't know and marks it "needs definition"
- This is a game-changer for requirements discovery!

Please confirm you understand the context and let's continue building the AST Generator!

## Additional Context Files to Reference if Needed:

1. **For understanding the module system:**
   - `.pipeline/factory-tools/module-system/MODULE-SYSTEM-PRD.md`
   - `.pipeline/factory-tools/module-system/module-account-core.yaml`

2. **For understanding ViewForge integration:**
   - `.pipeline/01-factory-tools/viewforge/VIEWFORGE-PRD.md`
   - `.pipeline/factory-tools/viewforge/viewforge-transformer.js`

3. **For understanding the overall factory:**
   - `.pipeline/SERVICE-SOFTWARE-FACTORY-BLUEPRINT.md`
   - `.sdlc/01-core/A-BUSM-VIEWFORGE-INTEGRATION.md`

## Signs You Have Full Context:

You should be able to answer:
- What is automatic gap discovery? (System finds undefined business rules automatically)
- What makes it special? (Transforms wireframes into requirements discovery tools)
- What are we building next? (AST Generator for real React components)
- Why AST over string concatenation? (Guarantees syntactically valid code)

## Emergency Recovery:

If context seems lost, these are the key achievements to preserve:
1. Automatic gap discovery is WORKING
2. VisualGapLogger is integrated in concept-generator-v3.js
3. Every wireframe now shows gaps automatically
4. Phase 1 Account module is complete with business rules
5. Next step is AST Generator foundation
