# Sprint 1 Handoff Document
*2025-08-22 - Three-Line Factory Operational*

## What We Built Today

### âœ… ViewForge v3 (Configuration Tool)
- Location: `.pipeline/01-factory-tools/viewforge/v3/`
- Status: Working, tested with Account List + Service Location
- Key Learning: Threw away v2, rebuilt from PRD in 2 hours

### âœ… Concept Line Generator (B&W HTML)
- Location: `.pipeline/02-concept-line/generator/`
- Status: Complete, generates semantic HTML
- Key Learning: Zero dependencies, smart sample data

### âœ… Prototype Line Generator (React + Tailwind)
- Location: `.pipeline/03-prototype-line/generator/`
- Status: Complete, generates interactive components
- Key Learning: Reuses same config, progressive enhancement

## The Working Pipeline

```
ViewForge â†’ JSON Config â†’ Concept Line (HTML) â†’ Prototype Line (React)
```

**Test Case:** Account List with Service Location name field
- Config: `.pipeline/02-concept-line/generator/test-fixtures/account-list-with-location.json`
- HTML: `.pipeline/02-concept-line/generator/output/account-list.html`
- React: `.pipeline/03-prototype-line/generator/output/account-list/`

## Key Documents Created

1. **PRDs with Conditions â†’ Impacts â†’ Solution:**
   - ViewForge PRD: `.pipeline/01-factory-tools/viewforge/VIEWFORGE-PRD.md`
   - Concept Generator PRD: `.pipeline/02-concept-line/generator/CONCEPT-GENERATOR-PRD.md`
   - Prototype Generator PRD: `.pipeline/03-prototype-line/generator/PROTOTYPE-GENERATOR-PRD.md`

2. **Learning Documents:**
   - ViewForge Learnings: `.pipeline/01-factory-tools/viewforge/VIEWFORGE-LEARNINGS.md`
   - Sprint 1 Summary: `.pipeline/SPRINT-1-LEARNINGS-SUMMARY.md`

3. **Principles:**
   - Concept Line: Black & white only
   - Prototype Line: "Make it real enough for feedback"

## Process Improvements Applied

1. **Jobs-to-be-Done** format > "As a user..." stories
2. **Throw away bad code** - v2 â†’ v3 was the right call
3. **Preview is mandatory** for configuration tools
4. **Test with real data** immediately
5. **As-built documentation** - what we actually built

## Current State

All three lines are operational. You can:
1. Configure a view in ViewForge v3
2. Generate B&W HTML with Concept Generator
3. Generate React components with Prototype Generator

## Next Sprint Possibilities

- Add more view types (detail, list)
- Build Production Line generator
- Add more entities (Work Orders, Service Locations)
- Reorganize folder structure (see REORGANIZATION-EXAMPLES.md)
- Create automated pipeline runner

# Starter Prompt for New Thread

```
I'm continuing work on the Configuration-Driven UI Factory. In the previous session we:

1. Built ViewForge v3 - a visual configuration tool for defining UI views
2. Built Concept Line Generator - generates B&W HTML from configs 
3. Built Prototype Line Generator - generates React+Tailwind components
4. Successfully tested the pipeline with an Account List view including Service Location fields

The three-line factory is now operational:
- Configuration Line: ViewForge at .pipeline/01-factory-tools/viewforge/v3/
- Concept Line: Generator at .pipeline/02-concept-line/generator/
- Prototype Line: Generator at .pipeline/03-prototype-line/generator/

Key learnings from Sprint 1:
- Jobs-to-be-Done format works better than user stories
- Throwing away bad code (v2) was the right decision
- Preview is essential for configuration tools
- Test with real data immediately

All PRDs and learning documents are in place. The pipeline successfully transforms ViewForge configurations through all three lines.

Please read the HANDOFF-SPRINT-1-COMPLETE.md file in .pipeline/ for full context.

What should we tackle in Sprint 2?
