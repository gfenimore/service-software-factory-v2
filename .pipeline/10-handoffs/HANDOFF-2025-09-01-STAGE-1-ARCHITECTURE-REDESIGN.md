### Major Architecture Decisions Made
| Decision | From | To | Rationale |
|----------|------|----|------------|
| **Entity Selection** | Parse from feature specs | Direct selection from BUSM.mmd | Eliminates parsing failures, BUSM is single source of truth |
| **Business Rules** | Manual definition via UI | Auto-generated from BUSM + 3-layer inheritance | 90% automation, Service Software Factory standardization |
| **Scope Definition** | CLI-based | UI form-driven | User preference, better UX for rapid delivery |
| **Template Approach** | Build from scratch each time | Save/load service type templates | Creates reusable "Pest Control Base Template" for all clients |
| **Component Generation** | Manual specification | Auto-generated 3-column layout | Standardized Master View across all service types |

## 🏗️ New Stage 1 Architecture

### Service Software Factory Approach
```
Service Software Factory = Standardized 4-Module Framework
├── Accounts Module (Customer management) ✅ DESIGNED  
├── Operations Module (Service delivery) - PENDING
├── Reporting Module (Analytics/dashboards) - PENDING
└── Administration Module (Settings/users) - PENDING

Each service type (Pest Control, Lawn Care, Diver Management) = 90% identical base + 10% customization
```

### Stage 1: Template-Based Requirements Capture
```
F2.1: Scope Definition via UI Form (Service + Client + Module)
F2.2: Entity Selection from BUSM.mmd (Direct selection vs extraction)  
F2.3: Component Auto-Generation (3-column Master View template)
F2.4: Business Rules Auto-Generation (3-layer inheritance)
F2.5: Template Management (Save/load configurations)
```

### 3-Column Master View Layout (Accounts Module)
```
Column 1: Account Hub        Column 2: Service Locations    Column 3: Work Orders
├─ Account (card view)      ├─ ServiceLocation            ├─ WorkOrder  
├─ Contacts                 ├─ LocationContact            ├─ WorkOrderItem
├─ Communications           ├─ LocationCommunicationLog   ├─ WorkOrderAssignment
├─ ServiceAgreements        └─ (when account selected)    └─ (when location selected)
├─ AgreementItems           
├─ Invoices
├─ InvoiceLineItems
├─ Payments/Credits
└─ (primary view)
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Updated Documents
1. **PIPELINE-ORCHESTRATOR-PRD.md** 
   - Functional requirements F2.1-F2.5 completely rewritten
   - Input requirements updated to UI form + BUSM approach
   - Output artifacts updated with new Stage 1 outputs
   - Data flow diagram updated for template-based approach
   - **NO HARD-CODED PATHS** - Uses `{configurable}` throughout

2. **STAGE-1-SEQUENCE-DIAGRAM.md**
   - Complete sequence diagram rewrite (85 lines of new Mermaid)
   - Shows UI form → Entity selection → Auto-generation → Template save flow
   - Reflects actual BUSM entities from real BUSM.mmd file
   - Template-based approach with "Pest Control Base Template" creation

### Business Rules Automation Breakthrough
```
Layer 1: BASE RULES (Auto-generated from BUSM.mmd)
├─ Database constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, FK)
├─ Field validations (email format, required fields)  
├─ Entity relationships (cascade rules)
└─ Standard state transitions

Layer 2: SERVICE-SPECIFIC RULES (Pest Control vs Lawn Care)
├─ Custom fields per service type
├─ Service calculations and workflows
└─ Service-specific state transitions

Layer 3: CLIENT-SPECIFIC RULES (ABC Pest Control customizations)
├─ Business process rules (approval workflows)
├─ Integration rules (QuickBooks sync)
└─ Custom client workflows
```

**Result:** ~90% rule automation from BUSM structure + inheritance patterns

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next Session)
1. **Complete Stage 1 Documentation Updates** - 20 minutes
   - Update Stage 1 sequence viewer with new architecture
   - Remove any remaining hard-coded references
   - Document complete architecture decisions

2. **Validate Stage 2 Integration** - 30 minutes
   - Read actual Stage 2 implementation
   - Ensure our new Stage 1 outputs match Stage 2 input requirements
   - Test data contract compatibility

3. **Stage 2 Architecture Review** - 45 minutes
   - Apply same systematic review process to Stage 2
   - Read Stage 2 PRDs, identify sync issues
   - Ensure Stage 2 supports template-based approach

4. **Continue Pipeline Validation** - 60 minutes
   - Stage 3-6 systematic review
   - Complete pipeline architecture alignment
   - Prepare for implementation phase

### Implementation Roadmap (Future Sessions)
- **Phase 1**: Stage 1 UI form implementation
- **Phase 2**: BUSM → Rules generation engine  
- **Phase 3**: Template save/load system
- **Phase 4**: Stage 2 integration testing

## 📝 Critical Learnings & Process Improvements

### What Worked Exceptionally Well
1. **Process Discipline Enforcement**: Caught fabricated BUSM entities, enforced single source of truth
2. **Systematic Questioning**: "Where are you getting email and creditLimit from?" - called out assumptions
3. **Service Software Factory Insight**: Recognizing 90% standardization across service types
4. **Template-Based Approach**: Creates reusable foundation for rapid client delivery
5. **3-Layer Business Rules**: Solves the "I am NOT manually defining rules" requirement

### Process Discipline Violations Caught & Corrected
- ❌ **Fabricating BUSM entities** without reading actual BUSM.mmd  
- ❌ **Building viewers without updating source diagrams first**
- ❌ **Making technical decisions without architectural context**
- ✅ **Corrected**: Always read source of truth before designing
- ✅ **Corrected**: Update documentation immediately when making decisions

### Architecture Breakthroughs
1. **Entity Selection Simplification**: Direct selection eliminates complex parsing
2. **Business Rules Automation**: 90% generated automatically from BUSM + patterns
3. **Template Reusability**: "Pest Control Base Template" → All pest control clients
4. **Component Standardization**: 3-column layout → Predictable, learnable UX

## 🔗 Key Files Updated (Next Session)

### Must Review Immediately
- `.pipeline/01-concept-line/orchestrator/PIPELINE-ORCHESTRATOR-PRD.md` - **CRITICAL** - Updated architecture
- `.pipeline/01-concept-line/models/STAGE-1-SEQUENCE-DIAGRAM.md` - **CRITICAL** - New sequence flow
- `.pipeline/00-requirements/models/BUSM.mmd` - **SOURCE OF TRUTH** - Entity definitions

### Pending Updates (Next Session Tasks)
- `.pipeline/01-concept-line/models/system-flows/stage1-sequence-viewer.html` - Update with new sequence
- All architecture documents - Remove hard-coded references
- Stage 2 PRDs and implementations - Review for compatibility

### Template Files to Create
- Service type templates (Pest Control, Lawn Care, Diver Management)
- 3-column component specifications
- Business rules inheritance patterns

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders for Next Session

### Process Discipline (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. **Read source documents first** - Never assume or fabricate
2. **Update documentation immediately** - When decisions are made
3. **Single source of truth** - BUSM.mmd for entities, PRDs for architecture
4. **No hard-coded references** - Use `{configurable}` paths everywhere

### Architecture Principles Established
1. **Service Software Factory** - 90% standardization + 10% customization
2. **Template-Based Delivery** - Create reusable base templates
3. **BUSM-Driven Rules** - Auto-generate from entity definitions  
4. **UI-Form Driven** - No CLI approaches for user interaction

### Success Criteria for Next Session
- [ ] Stage 2 integration validated
- [ ] Complete pipeline architecture aligned
- [ ] All documentation current and accurate
- [ ] No hard-coded references anywhere
- [ ] Ready to begin implementation phase

## 💡 Strategic Insights

### Service Software Factory = Game Changer
This session established that we're not building "custom software" - we're building a **standardized service delivery platform** that can be rapidly customized per client. This makes the entire factory concept exponentially more achievable.

### Template-Based Delivery Model
- **First run**: Create "Pest Control Base Template" (foundational work)
- **Subsequent runs**: Load template → Customize → Deploy (rapid delivery)
- **Business model**: Fixed-cost rapid delivery + consulting revenue on customizations

### Automation Breakthrough  
We solved the business rules problem: 90% auto-generation from BUSM + inheritance patterns eliminates manual rule definition while maintaining customization capability.
