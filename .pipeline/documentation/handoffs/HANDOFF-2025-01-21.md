# 🔄 Thread Handoff Document

*Purpose: Continuity for Configuration-Driven Factory Development*

## 🎯 Mission Statement
Building a **Configuration-Driven UI Factory** for a Pest Control Management System that eliminates manual coding errors by generating UI from JSON configurations. Following Claude's approved hybrid approach: 80% configuration-driven, 20% agent-based for complex cases.

## 📍 Current Status

### ✅ What We've Accomplished
1. **ViewForge (Field Configurator)** - Working visual drag-and-drop field configuration tool
2. **Three Working Generators**:
   - `simple-html-generator.js` - Generates HTML views from ViewForge configs
   - `navigation-generator.js` - Creates context-aware navigation from JSON
   - `layout-generator.js` - Orchestrates components into complete applications
3. **Pest Control v1.0 Alignment** - Navigation configured for 4 roles, 4 functions
4. **Directory Reorganization** - Clean structure separating tools, configs, and outputs

### 🏗️ System Architecture (Three-Line Evolution)
```
Concept Line (HTML) → Prototype Line (React) → Production Line (Vue)
         ↑ CURRENT POSITION
```

## 🐛 Pest Control Domain Model

### Entities (Core Business Objects)
1. **Account** ✅ (Partially configured - List View only)
   - Fields: accountName, status, balance, type, primaryContact
   - Views needed: Detail View, Form View

2. **Service Location** ❌ (Not configured)
   - Suggested fields: locationName, address, account (parent), serviceType, serviceFrequency, preferredDay, timeWindow, lastServiceDate, nextScheduledDate
   - Critical for: Route planning, service delivery
   - Relationships: Many-to-One with Account

3. **Work Order** ❌ (Not configured)
   - Suggested fields: workOrderNumber, status, priority, account, serviceLocation, assignedTechnician, scheduledDate, timeWindow, serviceType, instructions
   - Critical for: Daily operations, technician routing
   - Relationships: Links Account, Service Location, Technician

### Roles & Access
- **Owner**: Full access to all 4 functions
- **Ops Manager**: Operations, Accounts, Reports (no Admin)
- **Administrator**: Accounts, Administration, Reports (no Operations)
- **Technician**: Operations only (mobile-optimized)

### Functions
1. **Accounts** - Customer management
2. **Operations** - Service delivery & scheduling
3. **Administration** - Business admin & compliance
4. **Reports** - Analytics & metrics

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Configure Service Location Entity
```bash
# 1. Open ViewForge
Open in browser: .pipeline/01-factory-tools/viewforge/configurator.html

# 2. Configure Service Location fields for:
- List View (for route planning)
- Detail View (for technician reference)  
- Form View (for new location entry)

# 3. Export configs to:
.pipeline/02-configurations/entities/service-location/
```

### Priority 2: Configure Work Order Entity
Same process as above, export to:
`.pipeline/02-configurations/entities/work-order/`

### Priority 3: Test Full Pipeline
```bash
# Generate views
cd .pipeline/01-factory-tools/generators
node simple-html-generator.js ../../02-configurations/entities/service-location/list-view.json ../../03-generated/concept-line/views/service-location-list.html

# Create complete app
node layout-generator.js ../../02-configurations/layouts/three-column.json ../../03-generated/concept-line/complete-apps/pest-control-app.html
```

## 🔑 Key Technical Details

### ViewForge Configuration Format
```json
{
  "entityType": "service-location",
  "contextType": "list-view",
  "header": {
    "fields": [{"path": "serviceLocation.locationName", "label": "Location Name"}]
  },
  "body": [
    {
      "rowId": "row1",
      "fields": [
        {"path": "serviceLocation.address", "label": "Address"},
        {"path": "serviceLocation.serviceType", "label": "Service Type"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Generator Commands
```bash
# HTML Generator
node simple-html-generator.js [input-config] [output-html]

# Navigation Generator  
node navigation-generator.js [nav-config] [output-nav]

# Layout Generator (combines everything)
node layout-generator.js [layout-config] [output-app]
```

## ⚠️ Critical Context for New Thread

### What's Working Well
- ViewForge drag-and-drop is intuitive and exports clean JSON
- Generators successfully consume configs and produce working HTML
- Navigation adapts properly to role/time context
- Layout generator successfully orchestrates multiple components

### Known Issues/Decisions
- Only HTML generators work (React/Vue not started)
- No database connections yet (using mock data)
- Context rules engine not implemented (navigation switching is manual)
- Only 1:1 relationships supported in ViewForge (no 1:many yet)

### Design Principles We're Following
1. **Configuration First** - All UI driven by JSON configs
2. **Single Source of Truth** - ViewForge configs drive everything downstream
3. **Crawl/Walk/Run** - Start simple (HTML), evolve to React, then Vue
4. **Context-Aware** - Built with hooks for future context adaptation
5. **Domain-Focused** - Every decision maps to pest control operations

## 📝 Questions That Need Answers

### For Service Location Entity
1. Can a location be serviced without being tied to an account? (one-time service)
2. What determines service frequency - location or account level?
3. Should service history be part of location or separate entity?

### For Work Order Entity
1. What are the valid status transitions? (Draft → Scheduled → In Progress → Complete?)
2. Can work orders be created without service locations?
3. How do reschedules cascade to other scheduled services?

### Technical Decisions
1. Should we implement React generators today or perfect HTML first?
2. When to add real database connections vs mock data?
3. Should forms be separate configs or derived from list/detail views?

## 🚀 Success Criteria for Today

### Minimum Victory
- [ ] Service Location fully configured (all 3 views)
- [ ] Work Order fully configured (all 3 views)
- [ ] One complete workflow demonstrated end-to-end

### Good Victory
- [ ] All entities generating proper HTML views
- [ ] Complete pest control app with navigation working
- [ ] One role's full workflow tested (e.g., morning dispatch)

### Excellent Victory
- [ ] React generator started
- [ ] Database schema derived from configs
- [ ] Context-aware navigation actually switching

## 💡 Pro Tips for Next Session

1. **Start with ViewForge** - Open `configurator.html` immediately
2. **Configure one complete entity** before moving to next
3. **Test generation after each configuration** - Don't batch
4. **Use the demos** to validate output looks correct
5. **Reference pest-control-navigation-demo.html** for role context

## 🎬 Opening Prompt for New Thread

```
I'm continuing work on the Configuration-Driven UI Factory for our Pest Control System. 

Current status:
- ViewForge configurator is working
- 3 generators operational (HTML, Navigation, Layout)
- Directory structure reorganized (.pipeline/01-factory-tools, 02-configurations, 03-generated)
- Account entity partially configured

Today's goal: Configure Service Location and Work Order entities in ViewForge, then test the full pipeline.

Please review the handoff document at .pipeline/HANDOFF-2025-01-21.md for full context.

Ready to start with Service Location configuration in ViewForge.
