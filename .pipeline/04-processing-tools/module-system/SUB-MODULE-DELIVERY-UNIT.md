# Sub-Module: The Atomic Delivery Unit
*The Smallest Deployable Increment with Clear Boundaries*

## The Critical Realization

A "module" is still too big! Even "Account Management" has too many moving parts. The **SUB-MODULE** is the right level of granularity for delivery.

## Current Problem with Module-Level Delivery

```
Account Management Module (TOO BIG!)
├── Account CRUD (could deliver this alone!)
├── Contact Management (separate deliverable!)
├── Account-Contact Relationships (another deliverable!)
├── Account Search (standalone feature!)
├── Account Import/Export (independent!)
└── Account Reports (completely separate!)

Trying to deliver ALL of this = Never ships!
```

## Sub-Module: The Right Abstraction

### What is a Sub-Module?

A sub-module is:
- **One cohesive feature** (e.g., "Account List & View")
- **Independently deployable** (works without other sub-modules)
- **Clear boundaries** (specific entities, views, rules)
- **Testable in isolation** (has its own tests)
- **User-facing value** (delivers something usable)

### Sub-Module Structure

```yaml
# sub-module-account-list.yaml
subModule:
  id: account-list-view
  name: Account List and View
  parent: account-management
  version: 1.0.0
  deliverable: true  # Can be deployed alone!
  
  # EXACTLY what this sub-module includes
  scope:
    entities:
      primary: Account
      fields: [id, accountName, accountType, status, email]  # Just what we need!
      operations: [read, list, search]  # No create/update/delete yet!
    
    views:
      - account-list  # The list view
      - account-card  # Card view variant
      - account-quick-view  # Modal preview
    
    navigation:
      entryPoint: /accounts
      parentMenu: main
    
  # What it depends on
  dependencies:
    required: []  # Can work standalone!
    optional: [user-authentication]  # Better with, but works without
    
  # What it provides to other sub-modules
  provides:
    routes: [/accounts, /accounts/list]
    api: [getAccountList, getAccountById]
    events: [account-selected, account-viewed]
```

## The Delivery Increment Hierarchy

```
Application
└── Module (account-management)
    └── Sub-Module (account-list-view) ← DELIVERABLE UNIT!
        └── Components
            └── Code

Sub-Module = Minimum Viable Feature
```

## Example: Account Management Broken into Sub-Modules

### Phase 1: Read-Only Operations
```
Sub-Module 1.1: Account List & View
- Just list and view accounts
- No editing capabilities
- DELIVERABLE: Users can browse accounts

Sub-Module 1.2: Account Search
- Add search/filter to list
- DELIVERABLE: Users can find accounts

Sub-Module 1.3: Account Details
- Full detail view
- Related data preview
- DELIVERABLE: Users can see all account info
```

### Phase 2: Write Operations
```
Sub-Module 2.1: Account Create
- New account form
- Basic validation
- DELIVERABLE: Users can add accounts

Sub-Module 2.2: Account Edit
- Edit existing accounts
- Change tracking
- DELIVERABLE: Users can update accounts

Sub-Module 2.3: Account Delete
- Soft delete with confirmation
- DELIVERABLE: Full CRUD complete
```

### Phase 3: Relationships
```
Sub-Module 3.1: Account Contacts
- Link contacts to accounts
- DELIVERABLE: Contact management

Sub-Module 3.2: Account History
- Activity timeline
- DELIVERABLE: Audit trail
```

## Benefits of Sub-Module Delivery

### 1. Clear Boundaries
```
Each sub-module has:
- Specific entities/fields (not all fields!)
- Specific operations (maybe just 'read')
- Specific views (maybe just 'list')
- Specific business rules (only what's needed)
```

### 2. Incremental Value
```
Monday: Deploy "Account List" → Users can see accounts
Tuesday: Deploy "Account Search" → Users can find accounts
Wednesday: Deploy "Account Create" → Users can add accounts

Each day = New capability!
```

### 3. Reduced Risk
```
Small increment = 
- Less code
- Fewer bugs
- Easier testing
- Quick rollback
- Fast fixes
```

### 4. Perfect Traceability
```
Requirement: "Users need to see accounts"
    ↓
Sub-Module: account-list-view v1.0.0
    ↓
Components: AccountList.tsx, AccountCard.tsx
    ↓
Deployment: Tuesday 2pm to Dev
    ↓
Validation: 5 users tested successfully
    ↓
Production: Wednesday 10am
```

### Build Record
```javascript
{
  build: 7,
  subModule: "account-list-view",
  scope: {
    operations: ["read", "list"],  // NOT full CRUD
    fields: ["id", "name", "type", "status"],  // NOT all fields
    views: ["list", "card"]  // NOT all views
  },
  delivered: "2025-08-23",
  status: "in_production",
  next: "account-search"  // Clear path forward
}
```

## The New Development Flow

```
1. Pick Sub-Module (small, specific scope)
2. Define EXACT boundaries
3. Build ONLY what's in scope
4. Test ONLY that scope
5. Deploy THAT increment
6. Get user feedback
7. Pick next Sub-Module
8. Repeat

Each cycle = 1-3 days, not weeks!
```

## Success Criteria for a Sub-Module

✅ Can be built in 1-3 days
✅ Delivers user-facing value
✅ Works independently
✅ Has clear boundaries
✅ Is testable alone
✅ Can be rolled back alone
✅ Has single responsibility

❌ NOT a sub-module if:
- Takes weeks to build
- Requires other parts to work
- Mixed responsibilities
- Unclear boundaries
- Too many entities

## Example Sub-Module Progression

```
Week 1:
Mon-Tue: account-list-view → DEPLOY → Users can see accounts
Wed-Thu: account-search → DEPLOY → Users can find accounts
Fri: account-quick-view → DEPLOY → Users can preview accounts

Week 2:
Mon-Tue: account-create → DEPLOY → Users can add accounts
Wed: account-edit → DEPLOY → Users can edit accounts
Thu: account-delete → DEPLOY → Full CRUD complete
Fri: Testing & refinement

Two weeks = Complete account management!
Each day = Something new in production!
```

## This Changes Everything!

Instead of:
- "We're building Account Management" (vague, endless)

We say:
- "We're delivering Account List View" (specific, bounded, 2 days)

The sub-module is our **UNIT OF WORK**, our **UNIT OF DELIVERY**, and our **UNIT OF VALUE**!
