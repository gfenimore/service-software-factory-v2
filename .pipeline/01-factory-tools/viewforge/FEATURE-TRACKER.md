## Risk Register üö®

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|------------|--------|
| BUSM schema mismatch | Medium | High | Validate against actual schema | Monitoring |
| Complex state management | Medium | Medium | Start simple, refactor later | Accepted |
| Browser compatibility | Low | Medium | Test in Chrome first, others later | Deferred |
| Performance with large datasets | Low | Low | Implement pagination if needed | Monitoring |

## Complexity Scale Reference
```
1 - Trivial: < 1 hour, straightforward
2 - Simple: 1-2 hours, well-understood
3 - Moderate: 2-8 hours, some unknowns
4 - Complex: 8-24 hours, significant unknowns
5 - Very Complex: > 24 hours, many unknowns
```

## Risk Scale Reference
```
1 - Minimal: Very unlikely to cause issues
2 - Low: May cause minor delays
3 - Medium: Could block progress temporarily
4 - High: Likely to cause significant delays
5 - Critical: Could derail entire project
```

## Status Definitions
- **not_started**: Planned but not begun
- **in_progress**: Active development
- **blocked**: Cannot proceed due to dependency/issue
- **testing**: Development complete, validating
- **completed**: Done and validated
- **deferred**: Postponed to later iteration
- **cancelled**: Will not be implemented

## Update Protocol

### When Starting a Feature
1. Update status to "in_progress"
2. Set actual_start timestamp
3. Begin elapsed_active timer

### During Development
1. Update elapsed_active every 30 minutes
2. Track blocked_time when stuck
3. Update percent_complete
4. Log sub-task completion

### When Completing a Feature
1. Set actual_end timestamp
2. Calculate total_elapsed
3. Set actual_complexity
4. Count actual_risk_events
5. Update status to "completed"
6. Add notes about learnings

### During Retrospective
1. Compare estimated vs actual metrics
2. Identify patterns in variance
3. Update estimation accuracy
4. Refine future estimates
