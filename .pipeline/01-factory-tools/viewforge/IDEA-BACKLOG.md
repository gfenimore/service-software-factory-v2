## Backlog Management Rules

### Priority Levels
- **5 - Critical**: Blocking work, implement immediately
- **4 - High**: Important for MVP, implement soon
- **3 - Medium**: Nice to have, implement when possible
- **2 - Low**: Future enhancement
- **1 - Someday**: Interesting but not planned

### Status Values
- **Critical**: Must fix immediately
- **Planned**: Scheduled for specific iteration
- **Open**: Available to work on
- **In Progress**: Currently being implemented
- **Completed**: Done and validated
- **Deferred**: Postponed indefinitely
- **Rejected**: Decided not to implement

### Review Schedule
- **Weekly**: During iteration planning (Mondays)
- **Post-Retrospective**: After each iteration (Fridays)
- **Monthly**: Full backlog grooming

### Adding New Ideas
1. Capture during retrospectives or development
2. Assign category and initial priority
3. Add source reference (iteration, retrospective, review)
4. Review in next planning session
5. Update status based on decision
