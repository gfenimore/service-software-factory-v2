# Master View Patterns v1.0: Service Industry Foundation
*The Core Patterns That Drive ALL Service Management*

## üéØ The Fundamental Truth

**"All services happen at a location"** - This is the atomic truth that simplifies everything.

This means:
- No location = No service = No work order
- Every cascade follows this natural hierarchy
- State management becomes obvious

## üìê Core Pattern: The Service Cascade

### Pattern Name: `service-cascade-3`
```
Account ‚Üí Service Locations ‚Üí Work Orders
   ‚Üì             ‚Üì                 ‚Üì
(WHO pays)  (WHERE we go)    (WHAT we do)
```

**Behavioral Rules:**
1. Select Account ‚Üí Locations filter, Work Orders clear
2. Select Location ‚Üí Work Orders filter for that location only
3. Change Account ‚Üí Everything downstream clears (natural, expected)
4. No multi-select (clarity over complexity)

## üîÑ State Transitions (Deterministic)

```
State 1: Nothing Selected
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Account Column: Show all
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Location Column: "Select an account"
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Work Order Column: "Select a location"

State 2: Account Selected
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Account Column: Show all, highlight selected
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Location Column: Show filtered by account
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Work Order Column: "Select a location"

State 3: Account + Location Selected
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Account Column: Show all, highlight selected
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Location Column: Show filtered, highlight selected
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Work Order Column: Show filtered by location

State 4: Account Changed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Instant transition to State 2]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Previous location selection: CLEARED
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Previous work orders: CLEARED
```

## üìä Layout Patterns for v1.0

### 1. Primary Pattern: `master-detail-detail` (MDD)
```json
{
  "pattern": "master-detail-detail",
  "columns": 3,
  "relationships": [
    {"from": "master", "to": "detail-1", "cardinality": "1:N"},
    {"from": "detail-1", "to": "detail-2", "cardinality": "1:N"}
  ],
  "selection": {
    "master": "single",
    "detail-1": "single",
    "detail-2": "view-only"
  },
  "cascade": {
    "direction": "left-to-right",
    "clear-downstream": true
  }
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Account ‚Üí Locations ‚Üí Work Orders
- Territory ‚Üí Routes ‚Üí Stops
- Building ‚Üí Floors ‚Üí Rooms
- Customer ‚Üí Contracts ‚Üí Services

### 2. Secondary Pattern: `master-detail` (MD)
```json
{
  "pattern": "master-detail",
  "columns": 2,
  "relationships": [
    {"from": "master", "to": "detail", "cardinality": "1:N"}
  ],
  "selection": {
    "master": "single",
    "detail": "single-or-action"
  }
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Technician ‚Üí Today's Work Orders
- Route ‚Üí Stops
- Invoice ‚Üí Line Items
- Equipment ‚Üí Service History

### 3. Time-Based Pattern: `temporal-cascade` (TC)
```json
{
  "pattern": "temporal-cascade",
  "columns": 3,
  "relationships": [
    {"from": "time-period", "to": "entities", "cardinality": "1:N"},
    {"from": "entities", "to": "details", "cardinality": "1:N"}
  ],
  "special": "time-aware-filtering"
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Week ‚Üí Days ‚Üí Work Orders
- Month ‚Üí Locations ‚Üí Services Performed
- Quarter ‚Üí Technicians ‚Üí Completions

### 4. Hub Pattern: `hub-and-spokes` (HS)
```json
{
  "pattern": "hub-and-spokes",
  "layout": "center-with-satellites",
  "relationships": [
    {"from": "hub", "to": "spoke-1", "cardinality": "1:N"},
    {"from": "hub", "to": "spoke-2", "cardinality": "1:N"},
    {"from": "hub", "to": "spoke-3", "cardinality": "1:1"}
  ]
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Location ‚Üí [Work Orders, Equipment, Contacts]
- Technician ‚Üí [Skills, Territories, Schedule]
- Account ‚Üí [Locations, Invoices, Contacts]

## üé® Visual Representation Language

### Conceptual Notation
```
Standard Cascade:
[A] ‚îÄ‚îÄ1:N‚îÄ‚îÄ> [B] ‚îÄ‚îÄ1:N‚îÄ‚îÄ> [C]

With Selection State:
[A‚Ä¢] ‚îÄ‚îÄ1:N‚îÄ‚îÄ> [B¬∞] ‚îÄ‚îÄ1:N‚îÄ‚îÄ> [C ]
 ‚Ä¢=selected    ¬∞=available    =empty

With Counts (future):
[A (12)] ‚îÄ‚îÄ> [B (5)] ‚îÄ‚îÄ> [C (0)]
```

### Empty State Messages

| Pattern | Column | State | Message |
|---------|--------|-------|---------|
| MDD | Middle | No parent selected | "Select an account to view locations" |
| MDD | Middle | Parent selected, no children | "No locations found for this account" |
| MDD | Right | No parent selected | "Select a location to view work orders" |
| MDD | Right | Parent selected, no children | "No work orders found for this location" |
| MD | Right | No parent selected | "Select an item from the left" |
| MD | Right | Parent selected, no children | "No items found" |

## üîß Configuration Schema v1.0

### Minimal Configuration (80% of cases)
```json
{
  "layout": {
    "pattern": "master-detail-detail",
    "entities": ["account", "serviceLocation", "workOrder"]
  }
}
```

The system infers everything else from entity relationships!

### Explicit Configuration (20% special cases)
```json
{
  "layout": {
    "pattern": "master-detail-detail",
    "columns": [
      {
        "entity": "account",
        "display": "all",
        "selection": "single",
        "empty-message": "Loading accounts..."
      },
      {
        "entity": "serviceLocation",
        "filter-by": "account_id",
        "selection": "single",
        "empty-message": "No locations for this account"
      },
      {
        "entity": "workOrder",
        "filter-by": "location_id",
        "selection": "none",
        "empty-message": "No work orders scheduled"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Progressive Enhancement Path

### Concept Line (v1.0 - NOW)
- Pure HTML tables
- Click = form submit
- Page refresh on selection
- Black & white only

### Prototype Line (v1.1)
- React with useState
- Click = filter without refresh
- Loading states
- Basic highlighting

### Production Line (v1.2)
- Vue with Vuex
- Optimistic updates
- Smooth transitions
- Full design system

## üîÆ Future Patterns (v2.0 Conceptual)

### Advanced Patterns (Keep in Mind, Don't Build Yet)

1. **Comparison Pattern**: Side-by-side of same entity type
2. **Matrix Pattern**: 2D grid (Technicians √ó Time Slots)
3. **Network Pattern**: Many-to-many relationships
4. **Workflow Pattern**: Sequential stages with actions
5. **Dashboard Pattern**: Multiple mini-patterns in tiles

### Behavioral Extensions (Conceptual Only)

1. **Breadcrumb Memory**: Path through selections
2. **Quick Filters**: Within-column filtering
3. **Bulk Actions**: Multi-select with action bar
4. **Drag Relationships**: Drag work order to different location
5. **Split Views**: Same data, different filters

## üìã Implementation Checklist for v1.0

### Required for Master View
- [ ] MDD pattern fully specified
- [ ] Single selection only
- [ ] Clear downstream on parent change
- [ ] Empty state messages
- [ ] Black & white for Concept Line

### Not Required (But Keep Extensible)
- ‚ùå Multi-select
- ‚ùå Aggregation counts
- ‚ùå Complex filtering
- ‚ùå Drag and drop
- ‚ùå Inline editing

## üéØ The Simplification Manifesto

By accepting these constraints:
1. **Single select only** ‚Üí Simpler state management
2. **Clear downstream** ‚Üí Predictable behavior
3. **No aggregations** ‚Üí Faster initial load
4. **Services at locations** ‚Üí Natural hierarchy

We get:
- **Deterministic behavior** (no surprises)
- **Instant understanding** (no training)
- **Fast implementation** (days not months)
- **Universal applicability** (all service industries)

## üí° The Key Innovation

We're not building a generic relationship browser. We're building a **Service Industry Control Panel** that happens to use relationship patterns.

The constraints ARE the innovation:
- Less flexibility = More usability
- Fewer options = Faster decisions
- Clear patterns = Industry standard
