## Date: 2025-01-21
### Session: Afternoon - Project Setup

#### Context
- What I'm building: ViewForge 2.0 project structure and SDLC
- Why: Need formal process to prevent lost work and context
- Previous session ended: N/A - First session

#### Progress
- [x] Created PROJECT-LIFECYCLE.md with complete SDLC process
- [x] Created CONTEXT-PRESERVATION.md for interruption recovery  
- [x] Created auto-commit.sh script for 30-minute saves
- [x] Set up documentation structure
- [ ] Execute launch sequence
- [ ] Create v2 directory structure
- [ ] Initialize with IMS

#### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Separate v2 from v1 completely - clean architecture without legacy code
- Decision 2: 30-minute auto-commits - prevent any work loss
- Decision 3: Three-week MVP approach - Week 1 ultra-minimal, Week 2 enhance, Week 3 complete
- Decision 4: Pure HTML/CSS/JS - no framework dependencies

#### Issues Encountered
- None yet - setup phase

#### Next Session
- Start with: Execute launch sequence from PROJECT-LIFECYCLE.md
- Goal: Have basic ViewForge 2.0 HTML structure running

#### Files Modified
- PROJECT-LIFECYCLE.md - Created complete SDLC documentation
- CONTEXT-PRESERVATION.md - Created context preservation system
- auto-commit.sh - Created auto-commit script
- DEVELOPMENT-LOG.md - This file
