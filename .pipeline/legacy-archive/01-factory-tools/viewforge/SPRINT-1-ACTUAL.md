1. # Sprint 1 - What We Actually Built

## Continuous Improvement Note
We're documenting what we ACTUALLY built, not what we planned to build. This enables honest retrospectives and continuous improvement of our SDLC.

## Completed Stories (Jobs-to-be-Done Format)

### ✅ Story 1: Establish Configuration Context
**Job:** When starting a new configuration, I need to establish where it belongs in the application hierarchy, so the generators know the proper context for code generation.

**Acceptance Criteria (What We Built):**
- [x] Select Module from dropdown
- [x] Select SubModule (cascades from Module)
- [x] Select User Story (cascades from Module) 
- [x] Choose configuration scope level
- [x] Display hierarchy in summary panel

**Known Issues:**
- User Story selection not saved to state (exports as null)
- No validation that story matches submodule

**Actual Complexity:** 2 (simpler than expected)
**Time Spent:** ~45 minutes

### ✅ Story 2: Select and Compose Fields  
**Job:** When configuring a view, I need to select fields from primary and related entities, so I can build realistic views that show data from multiple tables.

**Acceptance Criteria (What We Built):**
- [x] Select primary entity (Account, Service Location, Work Order)
- [x] Display available fields with type information
- [x] Select multiple fields maintaining order
- [x] Add related entity dropdown (populates based on primary)
- [x] Add fields from related entity WITHOUT clearing previous selections
- [x] Show selected fields in separate panel
- [x] Remove individual fields from selection

**What Works Well:**
- Preserves selections when adding related fields (v2 failed here!)
- Shows field types for context
- Clear separation of available vs selected

**Actual Complexity:** 3 (as expected)
**Time Spent:** ~1 hour

### ✅ Story 3: Preview and Export
**Job:** When I've configured my view, I need to see what it will look like and export it, so I can verify it's correct before sending to generators.

**Acceptance Criteria (What We Built):**
- [x] Generate table preview with selected fields as columns
- [x] Show 5 rows of sample data appropriate to field types
- [x] Export configuration as formatted JSON
- [x] Include full hierarchy context in export
- [x] Include field metadata (type, entity, isRelated)
- [x] Visual confirmation of successful export
- [x] JSON appears in textarea for copying

**What Works Well:**
- Live preview helps verify configuration
- Sample data makes it feel real
- Export includes everything generators need

**Actual Complexity:** 2 (simpler than expected)
**Time Spent:** ~30 minutes

## Sprint 1 Metrics

### Planned vs Actual
**Planned:** Single story "Configure Account List View"
**Actual:** Three distinct stories (Context, Fields, Preview/Export)

**Planned Complexity:** 5 (for monolithic story)
**Actual Total Complexity:** 7 (2+3+2 for three stories)

**Planned Time:** 8 hours
**Actual Time:** ~2.25 hours

### What We Learned
1. **Wizard steps are separate stories** - Each step does a distinct job
2. **Jobs-to-be-Done is clearer** - Better than "As a..." format for our context
3. **Preview is essential** - Can't configure what you can't see
4. **Related fields are critical** - Real views need multiple entities
5. **Throwing away code works** - v3 is better because we learned from v2

### What's Different from PRD
- PRD had monolithic stories trying to do too much
- PRD focused on technical capabilities, not user jobs
- PRD didn't emphasize preview/verification
- PRD assumed rigid hierarchy (we made story selection optional)

## Definition of Done (Retrospective)

For each story, we achieved:
- ✅ Working code in v3
- ✅ No colors (B&W only)
- ✅ Exports valid JSON
- ✅ Includes hierarchy context
- ✅ Supports related entities
- ✅ User can complete workflow

## Next Steps
1. Fix user story state bug (minor)
2. Create Concept Line generator consuming this JSON
3. Test through all three factory lines
4. Document generator requirements based on JSON structure

---

## Process Improvement Actions
1. **Use Jobs-to-be-Done format** for future stories
2. **Break down wizards** into separate stories per step
3. **Document actual vs planned** after each sprint
4. **Include preview** in all configuration stories
5. **Test with related entities** from the start
