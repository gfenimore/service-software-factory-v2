### What Was Added:
1. **Search Input Field** in the Accounts column header
   - Placeholder text: "Search by name, city, type..."
   - Real-time search as you type
   - Clean, integrated design matching the UI

2. **Search Functionality** that filters by:
   - Account Name
   - City (BillingCity)
   - Account Type (Residential/Commercial)
   - Account ID
   - Primary Contact Name

3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Account count updates to show "X accounts (filtered)"
   - Empty state when no matches found
   - Search icon and helpful message

### How It Works:
- Type in the search box
- Results filter instantly
- Clear the search to see all accounts again
- Click any filtered result to view its locations

### Technical Details:
- Added `searchAccounts()` function

   - "John" or "Sarah" (finds by contact name)

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
