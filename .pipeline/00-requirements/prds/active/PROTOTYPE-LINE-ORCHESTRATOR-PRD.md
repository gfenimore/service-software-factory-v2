# Prototype Line Orchestrator PRD

**Component**: Prototype Line Orchestrator (formerly Configuration Enricher)  
**Version**: 2.0  
**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Stage**: Stage 2 - Prototype Generation  
**Author**: Factory Development Team

---

## Overview

The Prototype Line Orchestrator serves as the main orchestrator for Stage 2 of the Concept Line pipeline. It coordinates the transformation of Stage 1 base system configurations into working UI prototypes ready for client testing and deployment. Acts as the single entry point called by the Pipeline Orchestrator to generate the "Prototype Line".

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Stage 1 produces base system configurations (17 universal entities + domain customizations), but clients need working prototypes they can test and interact with. The Prototype Line Orchestrator bridges this gap by generating deployable Master View and Analysis View prototypes with domain customizations applied.

### Success Criteria
- Single, reliable entry point for Stage 2 prototype generation
- Orchestrates Base System Loader, View Generator, and Prototype Assembler
- Generates working Master View and Analysis View prototypes
- Applies domain customizations (Pest Control, HVAC, etc.) to base system
- Outputs deployable HTML/CSS/JS prototype packages
