## Maintaining Process Discipline Through Requirements-Implementation Alignment

### Document Info
- **PRD ID**: PRD-ABS-001

- **Priority**: High

## üéØ Problem Statement

### The Problem
In a rapidly evolving software factory, implementations drift from their original PRDs. We build features, enhance systems, and modify behaviors without updating the corresponding requirements documents. This creates:

1. **Documentation Debt** - PRDs become outdated and unreliable
2. **Knowledge Loss** - New team members can't understand actual system behavior from docs
3. **Process Erosion** - Teams bypass PRD updates, weakening our discipline
4. **Audit Risk** - "As-built" systems don't match "as-designed" documentation
5. **Integration Issues** - Other systems integrate based on outdated PRD assumptions

### Current State Pain Points
- PRDs written during initial design phase become stale
- Implementation details evolve during development
- No systematic process to sync PRDs with actual code
- Manual updates are forgotten or inconsistent
- Gap between documented vs actual system capabilities

### Success Definition
A system that automatically detects implementation-PRD mismatches and provides tooling to keep requirements documentation synchronized with actual system behavior.

## üèóÔ∏è Solution Overview

### Core Concept
The **As-Built Synchronizer** is a system that:
1. **Analyzes actual implementations** (code, configs, APIs)
2. **Compares against corresponding PRDs** 
3. **Identifies gaps and mismatches**
4. **Provides tooling to update PRDs** to reflect reality
5. **Maintains traceability** between requirements and implementations

### Key Principle
> **"PRDs should reflect what the system actually does, not what we initially thought it would do."**
