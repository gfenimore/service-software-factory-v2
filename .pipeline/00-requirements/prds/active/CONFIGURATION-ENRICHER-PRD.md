# Configuration Enricher PRD

**Component**: Configuration Enricher  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-08-27  
**Stage**: Stage 2 - Configuration Enrichment  
**Author**: Factory Development Team

---

## Overview

The Configuration Enricher serves as the main orchestrator for Stage 2 of the Concept Line pipeline. It coordinates the transformation of Stage 1 outputs (entities, business rules) into enriched configurations ready for ViewForge consumption. Acts as the single entry point called by the Pipeline Orchestrator.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Stage 1 produces raw entity definitions and business rules, but ViewForge requires enriched configurations with validated entities, mapped relationships, and complete metadata. The Configuration Enricher bridges this gap by orchestrating the enrichment process.

### Success Criteria
- Single, reliable entry point for Stage 2 processing
- Orchestrates all enrichment sub-processes in correct sequence
- Provides comprehensive error handling and status reporting
- Maintains processing metadata for traceability

## Interface Specifications

### Primary Interface
```javascript
class ConfigurationEnricher {
  /**
   * Main entry point for Stage 2 enrichment
   * @param {Object} stage1Outputs - Paths to Stage 1 output files
   * @returns {Object} Processing results with status and metrics
   */
  async enrichConfiguration(stage1Outputs) {
    // Orchestrate complete enrichment process
  }
}
```

### Input Format
```javascript
// stage1Outputs parameter
{
  entitiesFile: './stage1-outputs/entities.json',
  businessRulesFile: './stage1-outputs/business-rules.json', 
  busmSubsetFile: './stage1-outputs/busm-subset.mmd'
}
```

### Output Format
```javascript
// Return format
{
  status: 'SUCCESS' | 'PARTIAL' | 'FAILED',
  entitiesProcessed: 3,
  rulesValidated: 12,
  mappingsCreated: 8,
  outputsGenerated: 3,
  processingTimeMs: 1250,
  errors: [...], // Array of error objects if any
  outputs: {
    'enriched-config.json': 'SUCCESS',
    'entity-mappings.json': 'SUCCESS', 
    'config-metadata.json': 'SUCCESS'
  }
}
```
