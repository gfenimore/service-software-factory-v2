# ViewForge Bridge PRD

**Component**: ViewForge Bridge  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Stage**: Stage 2 - Prototype Generation  
**Author**: Factory Development Team

---

## Overview

The ViewForge Bridge serves as the translation layer between Stage 1 base system configurations and ViewForge's visual configuration format. It transforms Stage 1 outputs (17-entity universal model + domain customizations) into ViewForge-compatible configurations that can be visually configured and exported as concept HTML. Acts as the critical integration component enabling ViewForge to consume base system configurations.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Stage 1 produces base system configurations (17 universal entities + domain customizations) in a format optimized for the universal service model, but ViewForge expects its own hierarchical configuration format (App → Module → SubModule → Story). Without a bridge component, Stage 1 outputs cannot be consumed by ViewForge, breaking the Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 progressive elaboration flow.

### Success Criteria
- Translate Stage 1 base system configurations into ViewForge-compatible format
- Map 17 universal entities to ViewForge entity definitions
- Apply domain customizations (Pest Control, HVAC, etc.) to ViewForge configurations
- Generate ViewForge hierarchy structure from base system configuration
- Preserve all customization metadata for ViewForge consumption

- **Cause**: Domain customizations reference non-existent fields or entities
- **Detection**: Customization validation against base system
- **Handling**: Skip invalid customizations, log validation errors
- **Recovery**: Provide specific field/entity correction guidance

### ViewForge Schema Incompatibility
- **Cause**: Transformed configuration doesn't match ViewForge schema
- **Detection**: Output validation against ViewForge schema
- **Handling**: Report specific schema violations with context
- **Recovery**: Provide transformation rule corrections and schema alignment

### Integration Declaration Conflicts

### Pest Control Service Domain Translation
```javascript
// Stage 1 Input
{
  domainCustomizations: {
    serviceDomain: "pestControl",
    additionalFields: {
      "SERVICE_LOCATION": ["pestType", "treatmentHistory"],
      "WORK_ORDER": ["chemicalsUsed", "safetyNotes"]
