# PRD: Pipeline Orchestrator
*Service Software Factory Stage 1 - Automated Processing Engine*

## Problem Statement
Stage 1 requires automated coordination between UI form data, BUSM parsing, component generation, business rule creation, and output file generation without manual intervention or error-prone file handling.

## Success Criteria
1. Processes UI configuration in under 10 seconds
2. Automatically generates 5 output JSON artifacts with 100% format compliance
3. Validates all outputs for completeness and structure
4. Provides clear progress feedback and error reporting
5. Integrates seamlessly with existing pipeline architecture

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Accepts JSON configuration from Concept Line UI Form
2. Triggers BUSM Parser with selected entities
3. Auto-generates 3-column component specifications
4. Applies 3-layer business rule inheritance (Base + Service + Client)
5. Creates 5 output files: scope-definition.json, selected-entities.json, component-specifications.json, business-rules.json, template-config.json
6. Validates JSON structure and required fields
7. Reports completion status with metrics (entities, components, rules counts)
8. Handles errors gracefully with actionable feedback

## Performance Metrics
- Processing time: < 10 seconds for typical configuration
- Output validation accuracy: 100%
- Error handling coverage: All failure scenarios

## Out of Scope
1. Real-time UI updates during processing
2. Multi-project parallel processing
3. Advanced rule conflict resolution algorithms
4. Integration with external data sources

## Dependencies and Assumptions
1. BUSM Parser component available and functional
2. Valid BUSM file exists with required entities
3. Template definitions available for service types
4. File system write permissions for output directory
