# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# BUSM Authority Gateway Framework

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Status**: Active  
**Priority**: Critical - System Integrity Protection  

## Problem Statement

The Service Software Factory experienced severe BUSM (Business Unified Schema Model) contamination with 66+ fake artifacts and 17+ active tools accessing unauthorized BUSM files instead of the single authoritative source (BUSM-master.mmd). This systematic violation of the "Single Source of Truth" principle compromised data integrity across the entire pipeline and made unauthorized BUSM access a persistent architectural vulnerability.

**Business Impact**:
- Complete loss of data integrity across Stage 1/Stage 2 outputs
- Systematic architecture failure affecting all pipeline components  
- Risk of fabricated entities (like "pestType") infiltrating production systems
- Developer time lost to contamination detection and cleanup
- Potential customer data corruption from invalid entity definitions

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Criteria
1. **Technical Impossibility**: Unauthorized BUSM file access must be technically impossible, not just policy-prohibited
2. **Entity Authenticity**: 100% of entities must be cryptographically verified as originating from BUSM-master.mmd
3. **Zero Workflow Disruption**: All existing tools continue working during migration with identical APIs
4. **Complete Audit Trail**: Every BUSM access attempt logged with full provenance tracking
5. **Future-Proof Protection**: New tools cannot create BUSM contamination by architectural design

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Gateway successfully loads and parses BUSM-master.mmd (341 lines, 27 entities)
- [ ] Cryptographic signatures generated for all entities, fields, and relationships
- [ ] Fabricated entities (pestType, ChemicalTreatment, etc.) detected and rejected with 100% accuracy
- [ ] Existing BUSM-Reader and BUSM-Parser tools work transparently through Gateway
- [ ] Performance overhead < 10ms for typical BUSM operations
- [ ] Complete audit log of all access attempts with caller identification
- [ ] Entity authenticity certificates can be generated and validated
- [ ] File system hooks prevent direct access to any BUSM files except through Gateway

## Performance Metrics

### Quantitative Success Metrics
1. **Entity Protection Coverage**: 27/27 BUSM entities (100%)
2. **Field Protection Coverage**: All entity fields cryptographically signed
3. **Relationship Protection Coverage**: All 46+ relationships validated
4. **Contamination Detection Rate**: 100% of fabricated entities blocked
5. **API Compatibility**: 100% of existing BUSM-Reader calls preserved
6. **Performance Target**: Gateway overhead < 10ms per operation
7. **Availability Target**: 99.9% uptime for Gateway services

### Qualitative Success Metrics
- Development teams confident in BUSM data integrity
- No manual contamination audits required
- Automated protection against future contamination attempts
- Clear understanding of entity provenance across all systems

## Out of Scope

### Phase 1 Exclusions (Current Release)
- **Performance Optimization**: Advanced caching and optimization features
- **Distributed Architecture**: Multi-server Gateway deployment
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed usage pattern analysis and reporting
- **Integration with External Systems**: Non-BUSM data source validation
- **Advanced Security Features**: Encryption at rest, advanced threat detection

### Future Considerations
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated contamination testing
- Advanced monitoring and alerting systems for unusual access patterns
- Performance optimization for high-throughput scenarios
- Support for BUSM versioning and migration workflows

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### Technical Dependencies
1. **BUSM-master.mmd**: Authoritative source file exists and is accessible
2. **Node.js Runtime**: Gateway requires Node.js 14+ for crypto functions
3. **File System Access**: Gateway needs read access to BUSM-master.mmd location
4. **Pipeline Configuration**: Existing pipeline-config.js for path resolution

### Business Assumptions
1. **Single Source Authority**: BUSM-master.mmd remains the sole authoritative source
2. **Migration Support**: Existing tools will be gradually migrated to Gateway access
3. **Developer Adoption**: Development teams will adopt Gateway APIs for new tools
4. **Maintenance Commitment**: Gateway system will receive ongoing maintenance and updates

### Risk Mitigation
- **Backup Strategy**: Full system backup before Gateway deployment
- **Rollback Plan**: Ability to restore direct BUSM access if Gateway fails
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive workflow testing at each migration phase
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of Gateway overhead and response times

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components
1. **BusmAuthorityGateway**: Main interface providing unified BUSM access
2. **EntityProvenanceValidator**: Cryptographic signature system for entity authenticity
3. **AccessControlManager**: File system protection preventing direct BUSM access
4. **AuditLogger**: Comprehensive tracking of all BUSM access patterns

### Technical Approach
- **Transparent Client Pattern**: Existing tools work through Gateway without API changes
- **Cryptographic Validation**: SHA-256 signatures for all entities, fields, relationships
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Real-time notifications for access attempts and validations
- **Layered Security**: File system, entity, field, and relationship level protection
