# PRD: Concept Line UI Form
*Service Software Factory Stage 1 - Requirements Capture Interface*

## Problem Statement
Product Owners need a user-friendly web interface to capture service requirements (scope, entities, business rules) without requiring technical JSON editing or complex configuration files.

## Success Criteria
1. PO can define service scope in under 2 minutes
2. Entity selection is visual and intuitive  
3. Business rule customizations are optional and UI-guided
4. Form validates inputs and prevents incomplete submissions
5. Generates configuration ready for pipeline orchestrator

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Service type dropdown with pre-defined options (Pest Control, etc.)
2. Client name free-text input with validation
3. Module/submodule cascading dropdowns
4. Visual entity selection from BUSM with field count display
5. Optional business rules customization section with conflict resolution
6. Template naming with auto-generation option
7. Form submission triggers pipeline orchestrator
8. Clear progress indicators and error messages

## Performance Metrics
- Form completion time: < 5 minutes
- Input validation accuracy: 100%
- Error rate: 0% for valid inputs

## Out of Scope
1. User authentication/authorization
2. Multi-user collaboration features
3. Real-time entity editing
4. Advanced rule scripting interface

## Dependencies and Assumptions
1. BUSM file exists and contains valid entity definitions
2. Pipeline orchestrator accepts JSON configuration input
3. Web browser supports modern JavaScript/HTML5
