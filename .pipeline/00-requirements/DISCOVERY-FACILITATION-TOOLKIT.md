- [ ] Prepare company context summary
- [ ] Review any existing documentation

#### **Interview Script Template**

**Opening (5 minutes)**
> "I'm going to ask questions to understand the business context and objectives for this software project. This will help ensure we build the right solution."

**Business Problem Discovery (30 minutes)**
- "Walk me through the process that's causing problems today."
- "What happens when this process goes wrong?"
- "How much time/money does this problem cost weekly?"
- "What have you tried to solve this before?"
- "If we don't build this software, what happens in 6 months?"

**Success Definition (20 minutes)**
- "How will you know this software was worth the investment?"
- "What metrics do you track today that this should improve?"
- "6 months after launch, what would make you call this a success?"
- "What would make this feel like a 'must have' vs 'nice to have'?"

**Constraints & Context (20 minutes)**
- "What's your budget range for this project?"
- "When do you need this operational?"
- "Are there any systems this must integrate with?"
- "What compliance or security requirements exist?"

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**
