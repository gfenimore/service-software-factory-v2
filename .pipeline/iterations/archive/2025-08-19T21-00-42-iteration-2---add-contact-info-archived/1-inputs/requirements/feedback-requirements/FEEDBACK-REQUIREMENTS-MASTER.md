# Master Feedback Requirements Document
**Generated**: 2025-08-19T20:58:11.448Z
**Total Requirements**: 5

## Overview
This master document tracks all requirements generated from user feedback.
Each requirement has been validated against the BUSM and is ready for pipeline processing.

## Requirements Summary

| ID | Feature | Priority | BUSM Entities | Status |
|----|---------|----------|---------------|--------|
| FB-REQ-001 | account-display | medium |  | Ready |
| FB-REQ-002 | account-display | high |  | Ready |
| FB-REQ-003 | account-display | medium | Account, Contact | Ready |
| FB-REQ-004 | account-display | medium | Account, Contact | Ready |
| FB-REQ-005 | account-display | medium | Contact | Ready |


## Pipeline Integration

To process these requirements through the Concept Line:

```bash
# Step 1: Parse requirements
node .pipeline/2-factory/processors/requirements-parser/REQUIREMENTS-PARSER.js \
  .pipeline/1-inputs/requirements/feedback-requirements/*.md \
  .pipeline/2-factory/validation

# Step 2: Generate stories
node .pipeline/2-factory/processors/story-builder/STORY-BUILDER.js

# Step 3: Plan implementation
node .pipeline/2-factory/processors/planner/PLANNER.js

# Step 4: Generate concepts
node .pipeline/2-factory/processors/concept-generator/CONCEPT-GENERATOR.js
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No One-Offs**: All feedback follows the same disciplined pipeline
2. **BUSM Validation**: Every field request is validated against the data model
3. **Traceability**: Complete lineage from feedback → requirement → story → task → implementation
4. **Mock Data**: Automatically generated from BUSM definitions
5. **Consistency**: All implementations follow the same patterns

## Next Steps

1. Review generated requirements specifications
2. Run through the pipeline processors
3. Validate generated concepts
4. Iterate based on additional feedback
