## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Concept Line)
- Console.log verification for all location interactions
- Manual testing of service status display
- Visual verification of all location states
- Performance timing logs for account switching

### Integration Testing
- Test with accounts column (US--001) selection events
- Test with work orders column (US--003) event emission
- Verify event bus communication timing
- Test rapid account/location switching scenarios

### User Acceptance Testing
- 3-click rule: Verify users can reach work orders in < 3 clicks
- Service status clarity without training
- Performance with 200 locations across accounts

## Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies:
- **US--001** (Accounts Column): Must be complete for account selection
- Event bus system must handle location events
- Mock location data must link to account data

### Integrates With:
- **US--001** (Accounts): Receives account selection events
- **US--003** (Work Orders): Provides location context
- **Future Detail View**: Location selection event consumer

## Mock Data Specifications

### Location Data Structure:
```javascript
{
  id: "loc_001",
  accountId: "acc_001",
  name: "Main Office Building",
  address: "123 Business Ave, City, ST 12345",
  serviceStatus: "scheduled", // active, scheduled, overdue, completed, none
  nextServiceDate: "2024-01-15",
  serviceType: "HVAC Maintenance",
  workOrderCount: 3,
  priority: "normal" // low, normal, high, urgent
}
```

### Service Status Distribution:
- Active: 40% (currently being serviced)
- Scheduled: 35% (future service planned)
- Overdue: 15% (past due service)
- Completed: 10% (recently completed)

## Notes

- Second column in navigation hierarchy - depends on account selection
- Must handle service timing information clearly for planning
- Performance critical for smooth navigation experience
- Service status visualization must be accessible (not color-only)
- Preparation for future bulk operations without over-engineering
- Console.log for all interactions in Concept Line implementation
