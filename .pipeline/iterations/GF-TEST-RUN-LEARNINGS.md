# Iteration Learnings Log

## Iteration: 2025-08-19T10-12-12-gf-test-run
**Date**: 2025-08-19
**Purpose**: GF Test Run - Testing the pipeline with clean slate

### Pipeline Execution

#### 1. Requirements Parser
- ✅ Successfully extracted 35 requirements
- ✅ 33 mandatory, 2 progressive
- ✅ 10 testable with validation rules

#### 2. Story Builder  
- ✅ Generated 5 user stories
- ⚠️ **ISSUE**: 11 mandatory requirements NOT mapped
- ❌ Unmapped requirements:
  - NAV-001: Rapid navigation
  - VIS-003: Work order status color coding  
  - INT-001: Quick status updates
  - STATE-001: Maintain selectedAccount state
  - TECH-001: Simple HTML/CSS layout
  - UX-001: Intuitive column relationships
  - COMP-001: All columns before promotion
  - PROC-001: User feedback incorporation
  - QUAL-001: No blocking UX issues
  - COMPAT-001: Browser compatibility
  - RESP-001: Mobile responsive

### Key Learnings

1. **Story Builder Limitation**: 
   - Uses hardcoded acceptance criteria
   - Maps requirements TO stories via text matching
   - Should generate stories FROM requirements instead

2. **Missing Coverage**:
   - Technical constraints (HTML/CSS, responsive) not in user stories
   - Process requirements (user feedback, quality) not mapped
   - Some visual requirements (color coding) have no matching AC

3. **Architecture Issue**:
   - Requirements → Stories mapping is backwards
   - Should be: Requirements → Generate ACs → Create Stories

### Action Items for Next Iteration

- [ ] Enhance Story Builder to generate ACs from requirements
- [ ] Add technical story template for non-functional requirements
- [ ] Improve requirement matching logic
- [ ] Consider separate technical requirements document
- [x] **FOUND**: We have Story-builder and Planner AGENTS in `.sdlc/01-core/A-agents/`
  - These should be used INSTEAD of automated processors
  - Agents can ensure 100% requirement coverage

### Questions to Answer

1. Should technical requirements be in separate stories?
2. How to handle process requirements (user feedback, quality)?
3. Do we need a "Technical Debt" story type?

### Success Metrics
- Requirements mapped: 24/35 (68.6%)
- Mandatory coverage: 22/33 (66.7%)
- **Gap**: 33.3% of mandatory requirements unmapped

## Pipeline Results

### 3. Concept Generator
- ✅ Generated HTML concept with 50 accounts, 240 locations, 1667 work orders
- ✅ Created validation report
- ✅ **3-click navigation PASSED!** (NAV-004)
- ❌ Event requirements failed (EVT-001, EVT-002, EVT-003)
- ⚠️ Performance metrics simulated (need browser testing)

### Validation Results
- Total Requirements: 35
- Testable: 10
- Passed: 7 (70%)
- Failed: 3 (30%) - all event-related
- Not Testable: 25 (71.4%)

### Key Findings

1. **3-Click Rule Success**: Despite missing requirement mappings, the concept correctly implements 3-click navigation
2. **Event System Gap**: Events not implemented in concept (needs custom JS)
3. **High "Not Testable" Rate**: 71% of requirements can't be automatically validated
4. **Missing Requirements Impact**: The 11 unmapped requirements didn't prevent concept generation but left gaps

### Critical Insight
**The pipeline works end-to-end but with significant gaps:**
- Automated processors miss ~30% of requirements
- Should use Agent prompts (Story-builder v2.1, Planner v5.2) instead
- Concept generation is resilient but incomplete

## Next Steps
1. Open HTML concept in browser for manual validation
2. Next iteration: Use agents instead of processors for better coverage
3. Consider adding event system to concept generator
4. Implement proper task generation with Planner v5.2
