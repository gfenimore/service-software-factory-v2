# Sprint 1 Learnings Summary
*End-to-End Spike: ViewForge → Concept Generator*

## Major Learnings Applied

### ✅ Process Improvements
1. **Conditions → Impacts → Solution** in all PRDs
2. **Jobs-to-be-Done** format for user stories  
3. **As-built documentation** (what we actually built vs planned)
4. **Throw away bad code** (v2 → v3 was the right call)
5. **Test with real data** immediately

### ✅ Technical Patterns Established
1. **3-step wizards** = 3 separate stories
2. **Preview is mandatory** for configuration tools
3. **Related fields from Day 1** (not "we'll add that later")
4. **Zero dependencies** is achievable and valuable
5. **Black & white only** forces focus on structure

### ✅ Architecture Decisions Validated
1. **Modular generators** (table.js, list.js, detail.js)
2. **Validation → Parse → Generate → Wrap** pipeline
3. **Context-aware sample data** (not generic)
4. **Full metadata** for traceability
5. **Semantic HTML** proves completeness

## PRD Updates Needed

### ViewForge PRD Updates
- [x] Conditions & Impacts section (already added)
- [ ] Convert user stories to Jobs-to-be-Done format
- [ ] Mark preview as REQUIRED (not optional) 
- [ ] Add "as-built" documentation requirement
- [ ] Update with 3-story wizard pattern

### Concept Generator PRD Updates  
- [x] Conditions & Impacts section (already added)
- [ ] Add sample data intelligence requirements
- [ ] Specify semantic HTML elements per layout
- [ ] Include real ViewForge contract (not idealized)
- [ ] Add validation error catalog

## Metrics from Sprint 1

### ViewForge v3
- **Time**: ~2 hours (after throwing away v2)
- **Stories**: 3 (Scope, Fields, Preview/Export)
- **Complexity**: 7 total (2+3+2)
- **Result**: Working configuration tool with preview

### Concept Generator
- **Time**: ~45 minutes
- **Modules**: 8 files
- **Lines of Code**: ~600
- **Result**: Zero-dependency HTML generator

### End-to-End
- **Total Time**: ~3 hours
- **Working Pipeline**: ViewForge → JSON → HTML
- **Test Coverage**: Real configuration tested
- **Documentation**: Learnings captured

## Process Improvements for Sprint 2

1. **Start with generator requirements** before building configurators
2. **Create test fixtures immediately** from real output
3. **Document field mappings** between systems
4. **Test related entities** in every story
5. **Capture learnings as we go** (not at the end)

## Key Success Factors

### What Made This Sprint Successful
1. **Willingness to throw away v2** when it didn't work
2. **Clear separation of concerns** (configure vs generate)
3. **Real data testing** revealed issues immediately
4. **Jobs-to-be-Done** clarified what we're building
5. **Continuous documentation** of decisions

### What We'll Carry Forward
1. **Test with real data** from minute one
2. **Preview everything** before committing
3. **Modular architecture** for generators
4. **Context-aware** sample data
5. **Learning documents** alongside PRDs

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. [ ] Update ViewForge PRD with learnings
2. [ ] Update Concept Generator PRD with learnings  
3. [ ] Create Prototype Line Generator PRD
4. [ ] Plan Sprint 2 scope

### Questions for Sprint 2
1. How does Prototype Line enhance Concept output?
2. What React patterns will we use?
3. How do we maintain configuration consistency?
4. Should we generate TypeScript types from config?
5. How do we handle state management?

## The Big Win

**We delivered a working story through the Concept Line!**

From configuration to generated HTML in one sprint, with:
- Real data (Account + Service Location)
- Full traceability
- Zero dependencies  
- Pure black & white
- Complete documentation

The factory pattern is proven. Ready for Prototype Line.
