# PRD Summary - Factory Tools Documentation
*Recovery Point for Tomorrow's Journey*

## Completed Today

### 1. Factory Tools Inventory
Created comprehensive inventory of all 16 tools in the factory:
- 8 Active/Implemented tools
- 8 Planned/Future tools
- Identified 11 tools needing PRDs

### 2. PRDs Created
Successfully documented the following tools:

#### Core Infrastructure PRDs
1. **BUSM Reader PRD** ✅
   - Single source of truth for entity definitions
   - Provides unified interface for all generators
   - Critical dependency for all lines

2. **ViewForge Transformer PRD** ✅
   - Converts v3 configs to simplified format
   - Focuses on structure and navigation
   - Currently implemented, needed documentation

3. **Theme Engine PRD** ✅
   - Manages styling without TypeScript conflicts
   - Prevents "death by thousand cuts"
   - Enables safe visual customization

4. **Sample Data Generator PRD** ✅
   - Creates realistic mock data from BUSM
   - Respects constraints and relationships
   - Smart field name inference

5. **Business Rules Configurator PRD** ✅
   - Separates business logic from data structure
   - Defines validation, state transitions, calculations
   - Critical for proper separation of concerns

### 3. Existing PRDs (Previously Created)
1. **ViewForge PRD** ✅
2. **Concept Generator PRD** ✅
3. **Prototype Generator PRD** ✅
4. **Gap Logger PRD** ✅
5. **Prototype Runtime PRD** ✅
6. **Generator Root Cause PRD** ✅

## Tool Status Summary

### Active & Working
- ✅ ViewForge v3 (needs simplification)
- ✅ ViewForge Transformer
- ✅ Concept Generator v2
- ✅ Prototype Generator (needs AST rebuild)
- ✅ Gap Logger (partially integrated)
- ✅ Theme Engine (basic implementation)
- ✅ Sample Data Generator (basic)
- ✅ Auto-commit script

### High Priority to Build
- 🔴 BUSM Reader (critical dependency)
- 🔴 Business Rules Configurator (separation of concerns)
- 🔴 AST-based Generator (fix root cause)
- 🔴 Prototype Runtime (see generated components)

### Future Needs
- ⚪ Production Line Generator
- ⚪ UI Hints Catalog
- ⚪ Configuration Version Control
- ⚪ Validation Test Harness

## Today's Major Accomplishments

### Phase 1 Complete: ViewForge Simplification ✅
1. Defined simplified output format
2. Built and tested transformer
3. Updated Concept Generator to use new format
4. Generated working HTML wireframes
5. Integrated Gap Logger

## Tomorrow's Priority Path

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Build BUSM Reader**
   - Implement according to PRD
   - Test with existing configs
   - Integrate with generators

2. **Start AST-Based Generator**
   - TypeScript AST builder
   - Component structure validator
   - Import resolution

### Next (Week 2)
3. **Compilation Verification**
   - In-memory TypeScript compilation
   - Error reporting
   - Fix-or-fail approach

4. **Prototype Runtime**
   - React host application
   - Component loader
   - Mock data integration

## Recovery Instructions

When resuming tomorrow:

1. **Check auto-commit status:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep auto-commit
   ```

2. **Review today's gaps:**
   ```bash
   cat .pipeline/generated/concept/gap-report.json
   ```

3. **Test current generators:**
   ```bash
   cd .pipeline/factory-tools/generators/concept-html
   node test-concept-v2.js
   ```

4. **Continue with AST generator:**
   - Start with GENERATOR-ROOT-CAUSE-PRD.md
   - Follow Phase 1 implementation plan
   - Use TypeScript compiler API

## Critical Principles Established

1. **NEVER SHIP BROKEN CODE** - Prime directive
2. **Fix root causes, not symptoms** - No more workarounds
3. **ViewForge = Wireframes only** - Clear separation
4. **BUSM = Single source of truth** - Data definitions
5. **Gap Logger = Continuous improvement** - Track everything

## The State of the Factory

**What Works:**
- Concept Line generates clickable HTML wireframes ✅
- ViewForge transforms to simplified format ✅
- Gap Logger tracks missing information ✅
- Theme system prevents TypeScript conflicts ✅

**What's Broken:**
- Prototype Generator uses string concatenation ❌
- No compilation verification ❌
- No runtime to see React components ❌
- BUSM Reader not implemented ❌

**What's Next:**
- Build AST-based generator (fix root cause)
- Implement compilation verification
- Create Prototype Runtime
- Build BUSM Reader

*End of Day Summary*
*Date: 2025-01-22*
*Ready for Tomorrow: YES*

## Final Note

All critical work is documented in PRDs. The factory can be fully understood and resumed from these documents. The path forward is clear: Build AST-based generation with compilation verification to fulfill our prime directive - NEVER SHIP BROKEN CODE.

Good night! 🏭
