# Integration Architecture Specification
## Factory Pattern Evolution for Third-Party Integrations

**Document Type**: Architecture Specification  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Active  
**Location**: .pipeline/factory-tools/  

---

## Executive Summary

This specification defines how the Service Software Factory incorporates third-party integrations while maintaining the integrity of our single-source-of-truth principle. It establishes a clear pattern where every integration must be rooted in a concept-phase declaration, ensuring idea integrity across all factory phases.

## Problem Statement

The factory's unidirectional flow (Concept → Prototype → Production) creates a challenge when incorporating third-party services like MapBox, payment processors, or communication APIs. These integrations have no meaningful representation in the pure HTML/CSS concept phase, yet are essential for prototype and production functionality.

Without a clear integration pattern, we risk:
- Breaking the single-source-of-truth principle
- Creating "magic" features that appear without conceptual foundation
- Losing traceability between concept intentions and implemented features
- Making technology decisions too early in the design process

## Core Principle

**Every integration in the prototype or production phase MUST have a corresponding reference in the concept phase.**

This principle ensures:
- **Idea Integrity**: Features don't materialize from nowhere
- **Traceability**: Every capability traces back to a concept intention
- **Flexibility**: Technology choices remain separate from capability requirements
- **Documentation**: The concept phase documents WHY an integration exists

## Architecture Pattern

### 1. Concept Annotations

Concept phase components declare integration points using semantic annotations that describe capabilities, not implementations:

```html
<!-- Concept Phase Output -->
<div class="service-location-component">
  <div data-integration="address-validation" class="address-selector-placeholder">
    <!-- Placeholder: "Select Valid Service Address" -->
  </div>
  <div data-integration="geographic-display" class="location-display-placeholder">
    <!-- Placeholder: "Geographic Display Area" -->
  </div>
</div>
```

Key points:
- Annotations describe **what** not **how**
- Use capability-focused naming (e.g., "address-validation" not "google-places-api")
- Maintain black-and-white visual representation
- Include human-readable placeholders

### 2. Enhancement Manifests

Each integration point has a corresponding enhancement manifest that defines phase-specific implementations:

```yaml
# factory/integrations/address-validation.yaml
address-validation:
  concept:
    render: "input-placeholder"
    label: "Select Valid Service Address"
    purpose: "Ensure accurate service location data"
    annotations:
      - validates: "street address"
      - requires: "geocoding"
      - outputs: ["formatted_address", "coordinates", "place_id"]
  
  prototype:
    integration: "google-places-autocomplete"
    features:
      - address-autocomplete
      - address-validation
      - coordinate-extraction
    config:
      types: ["address"]
      componentRestrictions: 
        country: "us"
    
  production:
    integration: "google-places-autocomplete"
    optimizations:
      - session-token-pooling
      - result-caching
      - fallback-to-manual-entry
    monitoring:
      - api-usage-tracking
      - validation-success-rate
```

### 3. Progressive Enhancement Flow

```
Concept Declaration → Integration Mapping → Prototype Implementation → Production Optimization
        ↓                     ↓                        ↓                         ↓
   [What & Why]          [Technology]            [Full Feature]            [Optimization]
```

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Address Validation (Foundation for Mapping)

**Concept Phase**:
```html
<div data-integration="address-validation" class="address-input-placeholder">
  <!-- Text: "Select Valid Service Address" -->
</div>
```

**Prototype Transformation**:
```tsx
<AddressAutocomplete
  onAddressSelect={handleValidAddress}
  validation="strict"
  provider="google-places"
/>
```

**Why This Matters**: Valid addresses are the foundation for all geographic features. By establishing address validation at the concept level, we ensure data quality before any mapping occurs.

### Example 2: Geographic Display (Built on Valid Addresses)

**Concept Phase**:
```html
<div data-integration="geographic-display" 
     data-depends-on="address-validation"
     class="map-placeholder">
  <!-- Text: "Service Territory Map" -->
</div>
```

**Prototype Transformation**:
```tsx
<MapboxContainer
  locations={validatedServiceAddresses}
  displayMode="service-territory"
  features={['clustering', 'boundaries', 'routing']}
/>
```

## Integration Categories

### 1. Data Validation Integrations
- Address validation
- Phone number verification
- Email verification
- Business entity validation

### 2. Geographic Integrations
- Mapping displays
- Route optimization
- Territory management
- Geocoding services

### 3. Communication Integrations
- SMS notifications
- Email services
- Push notifications
- In-app messaging

### 4. Payment Integrations

- Financial reporting

### 5. Analytics Integrations
- User behavior tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking
- Business intelligence

## Technology Independence

The concept phase must remain technology-agnostic. Integration points should be named for their business capability, not their technical implementation:

**Good Integration Names**:
- `address-validation`
- `payment-processing`
- `customer-communication`
- `geographic-display`

**Bad Integration Names**:
- `mapbox-integration`
- `stripe-checkout`
- `twilio-sms`
- `google-maps`

## Manifest Structure

All enhancement manifests follow this structure:

```yaml
integration-name:
  concept:
    render: [how it appears in concept]
    label: [human-readable description]
    purpose: [why this exists]
    annotations: [semantic metadata]
    
  prototype:
    integration: [specific technology/service]
    features: [enabled capabilities]
    config: [service-specific configuration]
    
  production:
    integration: [may differ from prototype]
    optimizations: [performance enhancements]
    monitoring: [observability configuration]
    fallbacks: [failure handling]
```

## Version Management Strategy

### Versioning Structure

Integration manifests support explicit version management to handle API evolution, deprecations, and migrations:

```yaml
geographic-display:
  concept:
    render: "map-placeholder"
    label: "Service Territory Map"
    purpose: "Display service locations and territories"
    
  versions:
    v2:
      status: "stable"
      supported_until: "2025-12-31"
      prototype:
        integration: "mapbox-gl-js"
        version: "2.15.0"
        features: ["markers", "clustering", "3d-terrain"]
        
    v3:
      status: "beta"
      available_from: "2025-03-01"
      prototype:
        integration: "mapbox-gl-js"
        version: "3.0.0"
        features: ["markers", "clustering", "3d-terrain", "globe-view"]
        breaking_changes:
          - "New token format required"
          - "Clustering API changed"
        migration_guide: "./migrations/mapbox-v2-to-v3.md"
        
  active_version: "v2"
  migration_strategy: "parallel"
```

### Version Management Patterns

#### 1. Parallel Support Pattern
Run multiple versions simultaneously during migration periods:

```yaml
payment-processing:
  versions:
    stripe-v2:
      status: "deprecated"
      supported_until: "2025-06-30"
      prototype:
        integration: "stripe"
        sdk_version: "^8.0.0"
        
    stripe-v3:
      status: "stable"
      prototype:
        integration: "stripe"
        sdk_version: "^11.0.0"
        
  routing:
    strategy: "percentage"
    rules:
      - version: "stripe-v3"
        traffic: 90
      - version: "stripe-v2"
        traffic: 10
        condition: "legacy_customers_only"
```

#### 2. Feature Flag Pattern
Use feature flags to control version rollout:

```yaml
address-validation:
  versions:
    google-places-v1:
      status: "stable"
      feature_flag: "use_places_api_v1"
      
    google-address-validation:
      status: "testing"
      feature_flag: "use_new_address_validation"
      rollout:
        stage_1: ["internal_testing"]
        stage_2: ["beta_customers"]
        stage_3: ["all_customers"]
```

#### 3. Automatic Fallback Pattern
Define automatic fallback chains for resilience:

```yaml
sms-notifications:
  versions:
    primary:
      integration: "twilio"
      version: "4.0.0"
      
    fallback_chain:
      - integration: "aws-sns"
        version: "3.0.0"
        trigger: "primary_failure"
      - integration: "sendgrid-sms"
        version: "2.0.0"
        trigger: "all_previous_failed"
```

### Migration Workflow

#### 1. Pre-Migration Phase
```yaml
migration:
  announcement_date: "2025-01-01"
  deprecation_warnings:
    start_date: "2025-02-01"
    console_message: "MapBox v2 will be deprecated on 2025-06-30"
    documentation_url: "/docs/migrations/mapbox-v3"
```

#### 2. Parallel Operation Phase
```yaml
migration:
  parallel_start: "2025-03-01"
  parallel_end: "2025-06-30"
  monitoring:
    - metric: "api_errors"
      alert_threshold: 1.5x_baseline
    - metric: "performance"
      alert_threshold: 20%_degradation
```

#### 3. Cutover Phase
```yaml
migration:
  cutover_date: "2025-06-30"
  rollback_available_until: "2025-07-14"
  validation_checks:
    - all_features_working
    - performance_baseline_met
    - no_data_loss
```

### Version Compatibility Matrix

Maintain compatibility requirements between integrations:

```yaml
compatibility_matrix:
  geographic-display:
    v3:
      requires:
        address-validation: ">=v2"
        browser: ["chrome>=90", "safari>=14", "firefox>=88"]
      conflicts:
        legacy-mapping: "*"
```

### Testing Strategy for Versions

```yaml
testing:
  version_testing:
    automated:
      - unit_tests_per_version
      - integration_tests_per_version
      - cross_version_compatibility_tests
    manual:
      - user_acceptance_per_version
      - performance_benchmarks
    environments:
      dev: "latest_version"
      staging: "next_planned_version"
      production: "stable_version"
```

### Version Selection Logic

The factory uses this precedence for version selection:

1. **Explicit override**: Environment variable or configuration
2. **Feature flag**: If feature flag is set
3. **Routing rules**: Based on traffic distribution
4. **Active version**: Default stable version
5. **Fallback**: Last known good version

```javascript
// Factory version resolver pseudocode
function resolveIntegrationVersion(manifest, context) {
  if (context.override) return context.override;
  if (context.featureFlags[manifest.feature_flag]) return manifest.feature_version;
  if (manifest.routing) return applyRoutingRules(manifest.routing, context);
  if (manifest.active_version) return manifest.active_version;
  return manifest.versions.find(v => v.status === 'stable');
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Maintains Single Source of Truth**: Concept phase remains authoritative for what exists
2. **Preserves Abstraction**: Business needs separate from technical solutions
3. **Enables Provider Flexibility**: Can swap MapBox for Google Maps without concept changes
4. **Documents Intent**: Every integration has a clear business purpose
5. **Supports Progressive Enhancement**: Features grow richer through phases
6. **Ensures Completeness**: No surprise features in later phases

## Migration Path

For existing prototype features without concept representation:

1. Identify all prototype-only integrations
2. Create concept annotations for each
3. Generate enhancement manifests
4. Update prototype generators to read manifests
5. Deprecate hard-coded integrations

## Integration Discovery Phase

### Automatic Integration Scanning

Before the prototype generation phase begins, the factory pipeline runs an Integration Discovery process that ensures alignment between concept declarations and available manifests:

```javascript
// Integration Discovery Pipeline
{
  "phase": "pre-prototype",
  "steps": [
    "scan_concept_output",
    "extract_integration_points", 
    "validate_against_manifests",
    "generate_discovery_report",
    "auto_generate_stubs"
  ]
}
```

### Discovery Process

#### 1. Scan Concept HTML
Automatically parse all generated concept HTML for integration declarations:

```javascript
// Scanner identifies all data-integration attributes
const integrationPoints = scanConceptHTML({
  patterns: [
    'data-integration="*"',
    'data-depends-on="*"',
    'data-enhance="*"'
  ],
  output: {
    "address-validation": ["pages/service-location.html", "pages/new-account.html"],
    "geographic-display": ["pages/territory-map.html"],
    "payment-processing": ["pages/billing.html"]
  }
});
```

#### 2. Validate Against Manifests
Cross-reference discovered integrations with existing enhancement manifests:

```yaml
discovery_report:
  timestamp: "2025-01-23T10:30:00Z"
  
  valid_integrations:
    - name: "address-validation"
      manifest: "found"
      usage_count: 3
      pages: ["service-location", "new-account", "account-edit"]
      
  missing_manifests:
    - name: "route-optimization"
      usage_count: 1
      pages: ["dispatch-board"]
      severity: "blocking"
      
  orphaned_manifests:
    - name: "legacy-geocoding"
      last_used: "2024-12-15"
      recommendation: "archive"
      
  dependency_issues:
    - integration: "geographic-display"
      missing_dependency: "address-validation"
      pages_affected: ["territory-map"]
```

#### 3. Auto-Generate Stub Manifests
For new integration points discovered in concepts, automatically create stub manifests:

```yaml
# Auto-generated: factory/integrations/route-optimization.stub.yaml
route-optimization:
  _generated:
    timestamp: "2025-01-23T10:30:00Z"
    source: "concept-discovery"
    status: "stub"
    requires_completion: true
    
  concept:
    render: "placeholder"
    label: "[NEEDS DEFINITION] Route Optimization"
    purpose: "[DISCOVERED IN: dispatch-board.html]"
    
  prototype:
    integration: "[REQUIRES SELECTION]"
    features: []
    _notes: "Stub generated from concept discovery - requires completion before prototype generation"
    
  production:
    integration: "[REQUIRES SELECTION]"
```

### Discovery Report Format

   - Stub generated at: integrations/route-optimization.stub.yaml
   - Action: Complete manifest definition

2. **Dependency Issue**: geographic-display
   - Missing: address-validation dependency
   - Action: Add address-validation to service-location.html

### WARNING Issues (Should Review):
1. **Orphaned Manifest**: legacy-geocoding
   - Last used: 2024-12-15
   - Action: Archive or remove

## Auto-Generated Stubs
The following stub manifests were created and require completion:
- integrations/route-optimization.stub.yaml
- integrations/customer-notifications.stub.yaml

## Validation Passed
✓ 10 integrations have valid manifests and all dependencies satisfied
```

### CI/CD Integration

The Integration Discovery phase integrates with the build pipeline:

```javascript
// build-pipeline.js
async function prototypePreBuild() {
  const discovery = await runIntegrationDiscovery();
  
  if (discovery.hasBlockingIssues()) {
    console.error('❌ Blocking integration issues found:');
    discovery.blockingIssues.forEach(issue => {
      console.error(`  - ${issue.type}: ${issue.description}`);
    });
    
    if (discovery.hasAutoGeneratedStubs()) {
      console.log('\n📝 Stub manifests generated:');
      discovery.stubs.forEach(stub => {
        console.log(`  - ${stub.path}`);
      });
      console.log('\nComplete these manifests and re-run build.');
    }
    
    process.exit(1);
  }
  
  if (discovery.hasWarnings()) {
    console.warn('⚠️  Integration warnings:');
    discovery.warnings.forEach(warning => {
      console.warn(`  - ${warning.type}: ${warning.description}`);
    });
  }
  
  console.log('✅ Integration discovery passed');
  return discovery;
}
```

### Benefits of Integration Discovery

1. **Early Error Detection**: Catches misalignments before code generation
2. **Automated Stub Generation**: Reduces manual work for new integrations
3. **Orphan Detection**: Identifies unused manifests for cleanup
4. **Dependency Validation**: Ensures integration requirements are met
5. **Documentation Generation**: Creates reports for team visibility
6. **CI/CD Safety**: Prevents broken builds from missing integrations

## Validation Rules

The factory build process enforces:

1. **No orphan integrations**: Every prototype integration must have a concept annotation
2. **No missing manifests**: Every concept annotation must have an enhancement manifest
3. **Dependency validation**: Integration dependencies must be satisfied
4. **Configuration completeness**: Required manifest fields must be present
5. **Discovery completion**: All blocking issues from Integration Discovery must be resolved

## Future Considerations

This architecture supports future evolution:

- **Plugin marketplace**: Third-party developers can provide integration plugins
- **A/B testing**: Different prototype implementations of same concept
- **Multi-tenant variations**: Different integrations per customer segment
- **Gradual rollouts**: Phase features through production gradually

## Conclusion

By requiring every integration to have a concept-phase reference, we maintain the integrity of our factory pattern while enabling rich, real-world functionality. This approach ensures that our products remain conceptually coherent while technically sophisticated.

The principle is simple but powerful: **If it exists in the product, it must first exist in the concept.**
