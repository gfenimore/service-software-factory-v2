# üè≠ Factory Principles - The Laws of Our Factory

## The Prime Directive
**"NEVER SHIP BROKEN CODE"**

## Core Principles

### 1. The Quality Principle
**Getting it RIGHT is ALWAYS more important than getting it fast**
- Take time to build correctly
- Fix root causes, not symptoms
- No shortcuts that create technical debt

### 2. The Guarantee Principle
**If the generator produces it, it MUST work**
- Generated code always compiles
- Generated code always runs
- No "hope it works" - KNOW it works

### 3. The Fail-Fast Principle
**Broken code shall not pass**
- Generator stops if it can't produce valid output
- Better to fail during generation than in production
- Error messages tell you exactly what's wrong

### 4. The Root Cause Principle
**Fix the disease, not the symptoms**
- If ViewForge output is wrong, FIX ViewForge
- If config structure is bad, FIX the structure
- No workarounds, no escape hatches

### 5. The Single Source Principle
**Configuration drives everything**
- One config generates all stages
- No manual translation between stages
- Change config = regenerate = done

## What This Means for Development

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Spend time getting config structure right
- ‚úÖ Build generators that guarantee output quality
- ‚úÖ Fail immediately when something's wrong
- ‚úÖ Fix root causes even if it takes longer

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Generate "probably works" code
- ‚ùå Add validation after generation
- ‚ùå Create workarounds for bad input
- ‚ùå Ship with known defects

## The Factory Warranty

When our factory produces a component, we guarantee:
1. It compiles without errors
2. It runs without crashes
3. It has proper types
4. It integrates correctly

If it doesn't meet ALL these criteria, it doesn't ship.
