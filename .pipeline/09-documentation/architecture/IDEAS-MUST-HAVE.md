# 🚀 IDEAS - Must-Have Features List

## Purpose
Track essential features and tools we KNOW we need but aren't building yet. These aren't "nice-to-haves" - these are "we'll definitely need this" items.

## 🎯 High Priority (Needed Soon)

### 1. Business Rules Configurator
**Why:** BUSM shouldn't be overloaded with behavioral rules
**What:** Separate tool to define:
- Validation rules
- Business logic
- State transitions  
- Calculations
- Conditional requirements

**Output:** Rules JSON/YAML consumed by Prototype & Production lines
**Status:** Not started
**Discovered:** 2025-01-22 during ViewForge discussion

### 2. Sample Data Generator
**Why:** Realistic data needed for Concept Line
**What:** 
- Reads BUSM schema
- Generates appropriate fake data
- Respects relationships
- Creates edge cases

**Example:** 
- accountName → generates company names
- email → generates valid emails
- status → uses enum values

**Status:** Not started

### 3. UI Hints Catalog
**Why:** Visual presentation rules don't belong in BUSM
**What:**
- Currency fields → $ symbol
- Status fields → colored badges
- Dates → formatting preferences
- Priority fields → icons/colors

**Status:** Not started

## 🔄 Process Improvements

### 4. Gap Discovery System
**Why:** We need to systematically find what's missing
**What:** 
- Track every "guess" the generator makes
- Log missing attributes
- Report unclear relationships
- Surface assumption conflicts

**Example Output:**
```
WARNING: No display hint for Account.balance - assuming currency
WARNING: No navigation defined for Contact relationship - assuming clickable
WARNING: No validation rule for accountName - using type constraints only
```

**Status:** Concept only

### 5. Iteration Feedback Loop
**Why:** Each iteration should improve our knowledge
**What:**
- Capture what was missing
- Update BUSM documentation
- Refine generation rules
- Build knowledge base

**Status:** Manual process currently

## 🏗️ Infrastructure

### 6. Prototype Runtime (Already PRD'd)
**Why:** Need to run generated React components
**What:** Pre-built React app that hosts any component
**Status:** PRD complete, not built

### 7. Configuration Version Control
**Why:** Configs will evolve, need tracking
**What:**
- Version all configs
- Track changes
- Allow rollback
- Diff comparisons

**Status:** Not started

### 8. Validation Test Harness
**Why:** Ensure generators always produce valid code
**What:**
- Automated testing of all generation paths
- TypeScript compilation checks
- React render tests
- Business rule verification

**Status:** Not started

## 📊 Discovery Patterns

### Things We're Learning We Need:

1. **Navigation Rules** - More complex than expected
   - Breadcrumbs
   - Back button behavior
   - Deep linking
   - State preservation

2. **Data Relationships** - Need explicit definition of:
   - Cascade deletes
   - Orphan handling
   - Circular reference prevention
   - Lazy vs eager loading

3. **Field Metadata** - Beyond just type:
   - Display width
   - Sort priority
   - Group membership
   - Visibility conditions

4. **Business Context** - Not captured anywhere:
   - Why rules exist
   - Who made decisions
   - Change history
   - Impact analysis

## 📝 How to Use This List

1. **During Development:** When we hit a gap, add it here
2. **Planning Sprints:** Pick items from here
3. **Architecture Reviews:** Ensure we're building toward these
4. **Knowledge Capture:** Document WHY we need each item

## 🎯 The Key Insight

> "It's GOOD to discover gaps early. Each gap tells us exactly what tool we need to build. Better to find them now in Concept Line than in Production!"
