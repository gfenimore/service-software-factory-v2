## Key Documents

1. **Factory Requirements** - What the factory must accomplish
2. **Processor Contracts** - How processors communicate
3. **Pipeline Architecture** - How everything fits together
4. **Test Cases** - How we validate success

## Success Criteria

A successful pipeline run means:
1. The output LOOKS like the input (visual fidelity)
2. The output WORKS like the input (functional parity)
3. The output is BETTER than the input (progressive enhancement)

## Current Status

ðŸ”´ **FAILED** - Generated app doesn't match concept visually or functionally

## Next Steps

1. Document what went wrong
2. Define clearer specifications
3. Rebuild with validation at each step
