## Process Changes Required

### 1. Concept Generation Process

**Current State**:
```
ViewForge → Concept HTML → Done
```

**Future State**:
```
ViewForge → Concept HTML → Discovery → Validation → Done
```

**Changes Needed**:
- Add `data-integration` attribute support to ViewForge
- Update concept generator templates
- Document integration declaration patterns

### 2. Build Pipeline

**Current State**:
```bash
npm run factory:concept
npm run factory:prototype
```

**Future State**:
```bash
npm run factory:concept
npm run factory:discover-integrations  # NEW
npm run factory:validate-manifests     # NEW
npm run factory:prototype
```

**CI/CD Updates**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/factory-pipeline.yml
- name: Discover Integrations
  run: npm run factory:discover-integrations
  
- name: Validate Manifests
  run: npm run factory:validate-manifests
```

### 3. Developer Workflow

**New Commands**:
```bash
# Check integration status
$ npm run integration:status

# Create new integration manifest
$ npm run integration:create <name>

# Validate specific manifest
$ npm run integration:validate <name>

# Run integration tests
$ npm run integration:test
```

## Integration with Existing Tools

### ViewForge Integration
```javascript
// ViewForge configuration extension
{
  "component": "ServiceLocation",
  "integrations": [
    {
      "type": "address-validation",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "type": "geographic-display",
      "depends_on": ["address-validation"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Concept Generator Updates
```javascript
// concept-generator/index.js
function generateHTML(config) {
  // Existing logic...
  
  // NEW: Add integration attributes
  if (config.integrations) {
    element.setAttribute('data-integration', config.integrations[0].type);
  }
}
```

### Prototype Generator Updates
```javascript
// prototype-generator/index.js
async function generateComponent(concept) {
  // NEW: Load integration manifests
  const integrations = await loadIntegrationManifests(concept);
  
  // Apply integrations to component
  return applyIntegrations(component, integrations);
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Scanner performance | High | Implement caching, parallel processing |
| Manifest conflicts | Medium | Version locking, dependency resolution |
| Breaking changes | High | Gradual rollout, feature flags |
| Complex dependencies | Medium | Graph visualization, cycle detection |

### Process Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Developer adoption | High | Clear docs, automated tooling |
| CI/CD complexity | Medium | Phased rollout, fallback paths |
| Manifest proliferation | Low | Regular cleanup, orphan detection |

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success (Weeks 1-3)
- [ ] Scanner detects 100% of integrations
- [ ] Validation catches all manifest issues
- [ ] Stub generation reduces manual work by 80%
- [ ] CI/CD integration prevents bad builds

### Phase 2 Success (Weeks 3-5)
- [ ] Manifest management is self-service
- [ ] Version selection is deterministic
- [ ] Migration paths are automated
- [ ] Zero version-related production issues

### Phase 3 Success (Weeks 5-7)
- [ ] All integrations have test coverage
- [ ] Monitoring catches issues before users
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive
- [ ] Team productivity increased by 30%

---

## Resource Requirements

### Development Resources
- 1 Senior Engineer (full-time, 7 weeks)
- 1 Junior Engineer (part-time, weeks 3-7)
- 1 DevOps Engineer (part-time, CI/CD integration)

### Infrastructure
- No new infrastructure required
- Uses existing build pipeline
- Leverages current Git workflow

### Training
- 2-hour workshop on integration patterns
- 1-hour tool training session
- Documentation and examples

---

## Decisions Needed

### Immediate Decisions
1. **Manifest Format**: YAML vs JSON vs JavaScript
2. **Storage Location**: Monorepo vs separate repo
3. **Version Strategy**: SemVer vs date-based vs custom

### Future Decisions
1. **Plugin Architecture**: Extensibility approach
2. **Cloud Integration**: SaaS provider management
3. **Marketplace**: Sharing integrations between projects
