# Context-Aware Navigation Design
*Moving from Static Menus to Intelligent Guidance*

## The Core Insight

**Navigation should adapt to WHO you are, WHAT you're doing, WHEN you're doing it, and WHY.**

Traditional navigation is like a library's card catalog - everything is there, but you have to know where to look.

Context-aware navigation is like having a personal assistant who knows:
- What you usually do at this time
- What's urgent right now
- What you'll probably need next
- What problems are emerging

---

## The Context Model

### 1. Role Context
Different roles have fundamentally different mental models:

**Dispatcher**
- Thinks in: Routes, territories, time windows
- Needs: Real-time visibility, quick adjustments
- Pain points: Conflicts, delays, emergencies

**Technician**
- Thinks in: Sequential stops, service completion
- Needs: Current job info, next destination
- Pain points: Missing info, supply issues

**Manager**
- Thinks in: Patterns, trends, optimization
- Needs: Dashboards, reports, alerts
- Pain points: Surprises, inefficiencies

**Customer Service**
- Thinks in: Customer problems, quick resolution
- Needs: Search, history, action tools
- Pain points: Can't find info, complex processes

### 2. Time Context
The same person needs different things at different times:

**Morning (6-10am)**
```
Dispatcher Menu:
1. 🚨 Overnight Issues (3)     <- What happened while I was gone?
2. 🚫 Unassigned Routes (5)    <- What needs immediate attention?
3. 🌧️ Weather Impact           <- What might affect today?
4. 📅 Today's Schedule          <- What's the plan?
```

**Midday (10am-4pm)**
```
Dispatcher Menu:
1. 🗺️ Live Technician Map      <- Where is everyone?
2. 📞 Customer Queue (2)        <- Who needs help?
3. 🔄 In Progress (8)           <- What's happening now?
4. ⏰ Running Late (1)          <- What needs adjustment?
```

**End of Day (4-6pm)**
```
Dispatcher Menu:
1. ✅ Completion Status         <- Did we finish everything?
2. 📝 Tomorrow's Prep           <- What's set for tomorrow?
3. 🚩 Unresolved Issues         <- What's carrying over?
4. 📊 Daily Summary             <- How did we do?
```

### 3. Task Context
Navigation changes based on current task:

**During "Schedule New Service"**
- Customer info prominently displayed
- Available time slots highlighted
- Technician availability shown
- Pricing calculator accessible

**During "Handle Complaint"**
- Service history front and center
- Previous issues highlighted
- Escalation options visible
- Resolution templates ready

### 4. State Context
System state influences navigation:

**Crisis Mode (Multiple Emergencies)**
```
🚨 CRISIS MODE
├── Active Emergencies (3)
├── Available Resources
├── Escalation Contacts
└── Emergency Protocols
```

**Normal Operations**
```
📊 Operations
├── Dashboard
├── Schedule
├── Customers
└── Reports
```

## Implementation Levels

### Level 1: Time-Based (Crawl)
```javascript
if (hour < 10) {
  showMorningMenu();
} else if (hour < 16) {
  showMiddayMenu();
} else {
  showEveningMenu();
}
```

### Level 2: Role + Time (Walk)
```javascript
const context = {
  role: user.role,
  time: getCurrentTime(),
  location: user.location
};

const menu = selectMenuForContext(context);
```

### Level 3: Full Context (Run)
```javascript
const context = {
  user: { role, preferences, history },
  time: { hour, dayOfWeek, seasonality },
  system: { alerts, workload, performance },
  task: { current, recent, upcoming },
  patterns: { frequent, predicted, suggested }
};

const menu = AI.generateOptimalNavigation(context);
```

## Context Rules Engine

### Rule Examples

```javascript
{
  "condition": "unassignedRoutes > 0 && time < 10:00",
  "action": "prioritizeMenuItem('unassigned-routes')",
  "alert": "badge-urgent"
}

{
  "condition": "customerWaiting > 0",
  "action": "showFloatingAlert('customer-queue')",
  "priority": "high"
}

{
  "condition": "role === 'technician' && hasCurrentJob",
  "action": "pinMenuItem('current-service')",
  "style": "sticky-top"
}
```

---

## Adaptive Features

### 1. Learning from Usage
Track what users actually click and when:
- Frequently used → Move up
- Never used → Move down/hide
- Patterns → Predict needs

### 2. Predictive Loading
Based on patterns, preload likely next views:
- After viewing account → Likely to view locations
- After creating work order → Likely to assign technician
- End of route → Likely to complete paperwork

### 3. Smart Suggestions
```
Based on your recent activity:
• Complete service report for Acme Corp
• Follow up on yesterday's complaint
• Review tomorrow's route (15 stops)
```

### 4. Contextual Alerts
Don't just show alerts - show them WHERE they matter:
- Route delayed? → Show in dispatch view
- Inventory low? → Show in technician's chemical list
- Payment overdue? → Show in customer details

## The Journey Map

### Dispatcher's Morning Journey
```
Arrive (8:00 AM)
    ↓
See overnight issues immediately (3 urgent)
    ↓
Click to view details → System preloads assignment screen
    ↓
Assign technicians → System shows only available techs
    ↓
Confirm assignments → System updates route maps
    ↓
Dashboard updates → "Morning tasks complete ✓"
    ↓
Menu shifts to "Active Monitoring" mode
```

### Customer Service Journey
```
Phone rings
    ↓
Customer search auto-focuses
    ↓
Type name → Recent callers appear first
    ↓
Select customer → Full context loads
    ↓
Menu shows relevant actions:
  • View service history
  • Schedule service
  • Process payment
  • File complaint
    ↓
Complete task → Log interaction
    ↓
Menu returns to "Ready" state
```

## Configuration Structure

### Static Navigation (Old Way)
```json
{
  "menu": [
    { "label": "Accounts", "icon": "👤" },
    { "label": "Work Orders", "icon": "📋" },
    { "label": "Reports", "icon": "📊" }
  ]
}
```

### Context-Aware Navigation (New Way)
```json
{
  "contexts": {
    "dispatcher-morning": {
      "conditions": {
        "role": "dispatcher",
        "time": "6:00-10:00"
      },
      "menu": [
        {
          "label": "Overnight Issues",
          "priority": "urgent",
          "showIf": "hasIssues",
          "badge": "issueCount"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## The Vision

Imagine a navigation system that:

**Knows You**
- Remembers your preferences
- Learns your patterns
- Adapts to your style

**Understands Context**
- Time of day matters
- Current task influences options
- System state affects priorities

**Predicts Needs**
- Surfaces likely next actions
- Preloads probable views
- Suggests based on patterns

**Guides Success**
- Shows the path forward
- Prevents common mistakes
- Celebrates completions

This isn't just navigation - it's an intelligent assistant that helps users succeed at their jobs.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Time-Based Switching** (Quick win)
2. **Add Role-Based Variations** (Medium effort)
3. **Build Rules Engine** (Foundation for intelligence)
4. **Track Usage Patterns** (Data for learning)
5. **Add Predictive Features** (AI enhancement)

The beauty is we can start simple (time-based) and gradually add intelligence without breaking existing functionality.
