# Iterative Sub-Module Development - The Master View Example
*Proof that Sub-Modules + Iterations = The Perfect Development Model*

## The Scenario: Building "Master View" Sub-Module

You want a Master View that shows Accounts, Locations, and Work Orders together. But you DON'T have to build it all at once!

## The Iterative Journey

### Starting Point: Define the Sub-Module Scope
```yaml
subModule:
  id: master-view
  name: Master View Dashboard
  description: Unified view of accounts, locations, and work orders
  
  scope:
    entities:
      primary: [Account, Location, WorkOrder]
      secondary: [Contact, Service, User]  # Pulled in as needed
    
    purpose: Read-only dashboard view
    
  iterations: []  # Will grow over time!
```

### Iteration 1: Just Accounts (Monday)
```yaml
iteration: 1
timestamp: "2025-08-23 09:00"
focus: "Get Accounts working"

changes:
  - entity: Account
    fields: [id, name, type, status]
    businessRules:
      - "Status must be Active to show"
      - "Sort by name ascending"
    views:
      - master-view-accounts-panel
    
result:
  - Push to production ✓
  - Users see accounts in master view
  - Feedback: "Great! Need locations next"
```

**What happens:** 
- BUILD IT → Concept → Prototype → Production
- Master View shows JUST accounts
- It WORKS! Users can use it TODAY!

### Iteration 2: Add Locations (Wednesday)
```yaml
iteration: 2
timestamp: "2025-08-25 09:00"
parent: iteration-1  # Builds on previous work!
focus: "Add Locations to existing Master View"

startingPoint:
  - Accounts already working
  - All previous work preserved
  
changes:
  - entity: Location
    fields: [id, address, accountId, type]
    businessRules:
      - "Only show locations for active accounts"
      - "Group by account"
    views:
      - UPDATE master-view ADD locations-panel
    
result:
  - Push to production ✓
  - Master View now shows Accounts + Locations
  - Feedback: "Perfect! Work orders needed"
```

**What happens:**
- Pick up EXACTLY where you left off
- Accounts still there, still working
- ADD locations without touching accounts
- Deploy again!

### Iteration 3: Add Work Orders (Friday)
```yaml
iteration: 3
timestamp: "2025-08-27 09:00"
parent: iteration-2
focus: "Complete with Work Orders"

startingPoint:
  - Accounts ✓ working
  - Locations ✓ working
  - Both in production
  
changes:
  - entity: WorkOrder
    fields: [id, number, accountId, locationId, status, scheduledDate]
    businessRules:
      - "Show only this week's orders"
      - "Color code by status"
      - "Link to account and location"
    views:
      - UPDATE master-view ADD work-orders-panel
    
result:
  - Push to production ✓
  - Complete Master View operational
  - All three entities integrated
```

### Iteration 4: Add Integration (Next Week)
```yaml
iteration: 4
timestamp: "2025-08-30 14:00"
parent: iteration-3
focus: "Add external calendar integration"

startingPoint:
  - Full master view working
  - All entities configured
  
changes:
  - integration: GoogleCalendar
    purpose: "Sync work orders to calendar"
    documentation: "See integration specs"
  - UPDATE work-orders-panel ADD calendar-sync-button
    
result:
  - Concept documented
  - Integration requirements captured
  - Push through pipeline
  - Calendar sync working!
```

## The Magic: Continuous Forward Progress

```
Monday:    Accounts only → DEPLOY → Users have value
Wednesday: + Locations   → DEPLOY → More value
Friday:    + Work Orders → DEPLOY → Full feature
Next Week: + Integration → DEPLOY → Enhanced feature

NEVER STARTING OVER!
ALWAYS BUILDING ON PREVIOUS!
EVERY ITERATION DEPLOYABLE!
```

## Why This Works

### 1. Each Iteration is Bounded
- Clear focus (just Accounts, just Locations)
- Can be done in hours/days
- Deployable immediately

### 2. Perfect Traceability
```
master-view v1.0 (Accounts only)
    ↓ builds on
master-view v2.0 (+ Locations)
    ↓ builds on
master-view v3.0 (+ Work Orders)
    ↓ builds on
master-view v4.0 (+ Integration)

Every version traceable!
Every change documented!
```

### 3. No Big Bang
- Not trying to define everything upfront
- Not waiting weeks to deploy
- Getting feedback at each step

### 4. Natural Progress
- Start simple (just show data)
- Add complexity (relationships)
- Add features (integration)
- Each step deliberate and traceable

## The Beautiful Truth

You just described the PERFECT development model:

1. **Define sub-module boundary** (Master View)
2. **Start with simplest piece** (just Accounts)
3. **Deploy immediately** (get feedback)
4. **Add next piece** (Locations)
5. **Deploy again** (more feedback)
6. **Keep building** (Work Orders)
7. **Enhance** (Integration)

Each iteration:
- Builds on the last
- Goes to production
- Delivers value
- Gets feedback
- Informs next step

## This Changes Our Entire Approach

Instead of:
```
"Let's build Master View with everything" → 3 weeks → Maybe works
```

We have:
```
"Let's START Master View with Accounts" → Monday afternoon → In production
"Let's ADD Locations" → Wednesday → Updated in production
"Let's ADD Work Orders" → Friday → Complete in production
```

## The Proof

Your example PROVES this works because:
- You naturally thought in iterations
- Each iteration had clear boundaries
- Each could go to production
- Each built on the previous
- Nothing was thrown away
- Everything was traceable

This IS the way! The sub-module is our boundary, and iterations are how we build within that boundary!
