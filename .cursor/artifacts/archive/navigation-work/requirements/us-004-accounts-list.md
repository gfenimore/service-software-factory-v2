# US-004: Accounts List View (Reports)

## User Story

As a service company user
I want to view a list of all accounts
So I can see my customer base at a glance

## Acceptance Criteria

- I can navigate to Reports from the left navigation
- I can see a list of accounts with: Name, Status, Type, City
- I can see active accounts in normal text
- I can see inactive accounts in muted styling

## Business Rules

- Sort accounts alphabetically by name
- Show all accounts (no pagination in v1)
- Status must be "Active" or "Inactive"
- Type must be "Commercial" or "Residential"

## Out of Scope

- Search, filters, add, edit, delete
- Pagination, detail views
