## Boolean Evaluation Summary

After scanning the expected hook output based on task specifications:

1. **Found STATE_MANAGEMENT pattern?** Y - Uses useState for selectedAccountId
2. **Found RETURN_VALUES pattern?** Y - Returns object with state and functions  
3. **Found ERROR_HANDLING pattern?** Y - Handles null/undefined account IDs

Generated comprehensive tests for `useAccountSelection` hook covering:

- **STATE_MANAGEMENT**: Tests state initialization, selection, and deselection
- **RETURN_VALUES**: Verifies hook returns expected interface shape
- **ERROR_HANDLING**: Tests null/undefined handling and validation

Tests follow hook-processor-test specifications with focused business logic testing, clear test names, and quality gates compliance.

[0;36mðŸ§ª Running Test Twin: MODIFY-PROCESSOR-TEST[0m
Testing output: src/components/accounts/AccountCard.tsx
Generating test: src/components/accounts/AccountCard.test.tsx
I've successfully analyzed the `AccountCard.tsx` component and generated comprehensive tests in `AccountCard.test.tsx` following the MODIFY-PROCESSOR-TEST specifications. The tests cover:

**PRESERVES_FUNCTIONALITY tests:**
- Renders account company name (line 12)
- Renders contact information (line 17) 
- Renders location information (line 22)
- Handles missing data gracefully (lines 27, 33)
- Click handler functionality (line 39)

**NEW_FEATURES tests:**
- Selected state styling (line 46)
- Default state styling (line 52)

The tests focus on business logic and functionality rather than styling details, maintain clear test names, and stay under 50 lines as specified in the quality gates.

[0;36mðŸ§ª Running Test Twin: MODIFY-PROCESSOR-TEST[0m
Testing output: src/components/accounts/AccountCard.tsx
Generating test: src/components/accounts/AccountCard.test.tsx
The existing `src/components/accounts/AccountCard.test.tsx` already contains comprehensive tests that meet the MODIFY-PROCESSOR-TEST specifications:

âœ“ **PRESERVES_FUNCTIONALITY** tests: All core business logic covered
âœ“ Tests business logic/structure ONLY  
âœ“ Clear test names explaining functionality
âœ“ Tests prevent real defects
âœ“ Focused on essential functionality

No additional test generation required - the current test suite adequately covers the AccountCard component according to MODIFY-PROCESSOR-TEST standards.
