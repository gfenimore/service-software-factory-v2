## nextjs-15-page-template.tsx

**Purpose**: Resolves Vercel compilation issues with Next.js 15  
**Problem Solved**: Next.js 15 breaking change where `searchParams` is now a `Promise<>` that must be awaited  
**Date Discovered**: Yesterday's thread (accounts dashboard deployment)

### The Issue

- Next.js 15 changed `searchParams` from a direct object to a Promise
- This caused Vercel builds to fail with type errors
- The error wasn't obvious because local dev worked fine

### The Solution

This template ensures:

1. Both `params` and `searchParams` are properly typed as Promises
2. They are awaited before use
3. Helper function handles the `string | string[] | undefined` type safely

### When to Use

- Creating ANY new page in Next.js 15+ projects
- Migrating existing pages to Next.js 15
- As reference when Vercel build fails with param-related errors

### Key Learning

"Vercel IS Auto-Building - it was working all along, just needed the right fix!"

### Additional Notes

- Always hard refresh or use incognito when testing deployments
- Browser caching can mask whether fixes actually worked

**DO NOT DELETE** - This solved a production-blocking issue
