## Detailed Task Breakdown

## Task 1: Enhance Account Card Selection State with Detail Options

**VALUE_SLICE**: 1 - Account Selection with Details Modal
**DELIVERABLE**: src/components/accounts/AccountCard.tsx (modified)
**ESTIMATED TIME**: 30 minutes
**COMPLEXITY**: Medium
**DEPENDENCIES**: None
**VERIFY**: npm run dev && select account card to see contact details icon appear
**BUSINESS_RULE**: Selected account card shows additional action icons
**ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA**: When account card is selected, detail option icons (contacts, etc.) become visible

### Details

Modify the existing AccountCard component to show additional action icons (starting with contacts) when the card is in selected state. These icons only appear on the selected card, not on all cards.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Selected card shows contacts icon (and space for future icons)
- [ ] Icons only visible when card is selected
- [ ] Icons positioned appropriately within card layout
- [ ] Visual feedback on icon hover/click
- [ ] Selection state properly triggers icon visibility

### ðŸ§  Planning Reasoning

This establishes the pattern where selection reveals options, keeping cards clean when not selected. This follows the Master View philosophy of "see what you want, when you want."

## Task 2: Create Contact Details Modal Component

**VALUE_SLICE**: 1 - Account Selection with Details Modal
**DELIVERABLE**: src/components/accounts/ContactDetailsModal.tsx
**ESTIMATED TIME**: 25 minutes

**BUSINESS_RULE**: Contact details display in a modal overlay
**ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA**: Modal shows contact information with clear close mechanism

### Details

Create a modal component specifically for displaying account contacts and their communication logs. Modal should overlay the three-column view without disrupting it.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Modal renders as overlay (not panel)
- [ ] Modal has clear close button (X)
- [ ] Modal has proper backdrop/overlay
- [ ] Modal structure ready for contact data
- [ ] Follows existing modal patterns if any

### ðŸ§  Planning Reasoning

A modal is the right choice here as it temporarily focuses user attention on contact details without losing the three-column context. The modal preserves the master view structure.

## Task 3: Implement Contact Modal State Management

**VALUE_SLICE**: 1 - Account Selection with Details Modal
**DELIVERABLE**: src/components/accounts/useContactModal.ts
