# Handoff to ARCHITECT Development

## Current State

- PLANNER v3.0 successfully tested and verified
- Task breakdown created at: `.cursor/artifacts/current/planning/us-002-tasks.md`
- 23 tasks ready for architecture design
- Git commits complete

## Key Success Factors from PLANNER

1. Explicit file verification before starting
2. Clear output location requirements
3. Verification of work after completion
4. Principles with reasoning, not just rules

## ARCHITECT Next Steps

- Read tasks from: `.cursor/artifacts/current/planning/us-002-tasks.md`
- Create technical specifications for each task
- Output to: `.cursor/artifacts/current/design/us-002-architecture.md`
- Apply same verification-first approach
