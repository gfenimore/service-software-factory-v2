# Concept Line Consolidation Plan
## From Complex System to Production-Ready Pipeline

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Objective**: Transform the current Concept Line from a collection of experimental tools into a streamlined, production-ready pipeline that delivers consistent, high-quality UI wireframes from business requirements.

**Timeline**: 6 weeks (3 phases × 2 weeks each)
**Success Metric**: One-command execution producing validated HTML wireframes in under 5 minutes

## 🔍 Current State Analysis

### Working Tools (Keep & Enhance)
| Tool | Status | Location | Value |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| ViewForge v3 | ✅ Working | `01-concept-line/tools/viewforge/v3/` | High - Visual config |
| BUSM Reader | ✅ Working | `01-concept-line/tools/busm-reader/` | High - Business model parser |
| Concept Generator v3 | ✅ Working | `01-concept-line/tools/concept-generator/concept-html/` | High - HTML generation |
| Pipeline Orchestrator | ✅ Working | `01-concept-line/orchestrator/` | High - Automation |

### Partially Working (Fix & Integrate)
| Tool | Status | Issues | Action |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| Business Rules Configurator | ⚠️ Partial | UI exists but integration incomplete | Complete integration |
| Rule Collection UI | ⚠️ Partial | Works standalone, export needs work | Fix export pipeline |

### Experimental/Unused (Archive)
| Tool | Status | Reason | Action |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| Concept Generator v2 | 🟡 Legacy | Superseded by v3 | Archive |
| ViewForge v1/v2 | 🟡 Legacy | Superseded by v3 | Archive |
| Multiple test fixtures | 🟡 Scattered | Too many variants | Consolidate |

### Missing Critical Pieces (Build)
1. **AST-based validation** - Ensure generated HTML is semantically correct
2. **Quality gates** - Automated validation before output
3. **Error recovery** - Handle malformed inputs gracefully
4. **Performance optimization** - Sub-5-minute execution

   mkdir -p .pipeline/legacy-archive-YYYY-MM-DD
   
   # Archive old versions
   mv .pipeline/01-concept-line/tools/viewforge/v1 .pipeline/legacy-archive-YYYY-MM-DD/
   mv .pipeline/01-concept-line/tools/viewforge/v2-archived-learning .pipeline/legacy-archive-YYYY-MM-DD/
   mv .pipeline/01-concept-line/tools/concept-generator/concept-html/concept-generator-v2.js .pipeline/legacy-archive-YYYY-MM-DD/
   
   # Archive excessive test fixtures
   mv .pipeline/01-concept-line/tools/concept-generator/concept-html/test-fixtures .pipeline/legacy-archive-YYYY-MM-DD/
   ```

2. **Create Baseline Measurement** (2 hours)

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: Tools don't integrate smoothly
   - Mitigation: Incremental integration with fallback options
   - Contingency: Keep working versions as backup

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Risk: Consolidated pipeline slower than individual tools
   - Mitigation: Performance benchmarking at each step
   - Contingency: Optimize critical path, parallelize where possible

3. **Quality Regression**
   - Risk: Consolidation introduces bugs
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test suite with baseline comparisons
   - Contingency: Feature flags to disable problematic components

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **Configuration Conflicts**
   - Risk: Different tools have conflicting config requirements
   - Mitigation: Universal config schema with tool-specific sections

2. **Documentation Debt**
   - Risk: Outdated docs confuse users
   - Mitigation: Delete outdated docs, keep only essential ones

### Contingency Plans
- **Week 2 Checkpoint**: If quality gates aren't working, extend Phase 1 by 1 week
- **Week 4 Checkpoint**: If performance targets aren't met, reduce feature scope
- **Week 6 Checkpoint**: If system isn't production-ready, plan additional hardening sprint
