- [ ] Verify all team members can access new locations

### Short Term (This Week)

- [ ] Merge to main branch when ready
- [ ] Update team documentation
- [ ] Configure Azure DevOps mappings
- [ ] Update any CI/CD pipelines if needed

### Ongoing

- [ ] Update manifest input paths as new work items are created
- [ ] Gradually migrate any remaining hardcoded paths
- [ ] Monitor for any issues during daily operations

## Success Metrics

✅ **53 files** successfully migrated
✅ **0 files** lost or corrupted
✅ **100%** validation tests passed
✅ **2 safety tags** created for rollback
✅ **31 directories** properly organized

## Team Communication

Suggested message for team:
