# Thread Handoff Document - SDLC Retrospective & Feature Evaluation

## Thread Summary for Continuation

**Date**: August 13, 2025  
**Thread Focus**: US-005 Retrospective ‚Üí Validation Strategy ‚Üí SDLC Workflow ‚Üí Feature Document Evaluation

---

## üéØ Key Decisions Made

### From US-005 Retrospective:

1. **BUSM is source of truth** for all database design
2. **API routes for production**, direct DB for debugging only
3. **Use existing tools** (MCP Supabase) rather than building new ones
4. **Continue building features** (Columns 2 & 3) while refining SDLC

### From Validation Strategy:

1. **Progressive strictness**: Looser in dev ‚Üí Stricter toward production
2. **CC identified phantom rule**: `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` blocking despite not being configured
3. **Mood-based commands needed**: `dev`, `dev:quiet`, `dev:strict`, `dev:yolo`
4. **Two configs fighting**: `.eslintrc.json` vs `.eslintrc.processor.js`

### From SDLC Discussion:

1. **Software Factory Vision established**: Build systems that build systems
2. **70/30 Rule discovered**: 70% of work is templatable, 30% is human creativity
3. **Work hierarchy**: Epic ‚Üí Feature ‚Üí User Story ‚Üí Task
4. **JTBD format adopted** for user stories to maintain business context

## üìä Current State

### Where We Are:

- **US-005 (Contact Details Modal)**: ‚úÖ Deployed to production
- **Column 1 (Accounts)**: ‚úÖ Working with real data
- **Column 2 (Service Locations)**: üü° Ready to build (US-006)
- **Column 3 (Work Orders)**: ‚è≥ Next after Column 2

### What We're Evaluating:

- **Master View Feature Document**: 6/12 completeness score
- **Missing**: BUSM mapping, technical specs
- **Available**: Mockups (Human has them!)
- **Pattern identified**: Master-Detail-Detail (90% reusable)

### Key Insights:

1. **Requirements traceability**: Success criteria ‚Üí User story titles
2. **CC's pain points**: Phantom ESLint rules, pre-commit friction
3. **Factory opportunity**: Column 2 can reuse 90% of Column 1 patterns
4. **JTBD format**: Maintains business context throughout development

## üîÑ Active Discussions

### 1. Feature Document Completeness

- Does 6/12 score mean we need to improve the document first?
- Or proceed with US-006 and document patterns as we go?
- How do mockups fill the gaps?

### 2. US-006 Definition

- Needs JTBD format with full context
- Should trace to specific success criterion
- Must map to SERVICE_LOCATION entity from BUSM

### 3. Validation Rules

- Fix phantom TypeScript rule
- Resolve config file conflict
- Implement mood-based dev commands

### 4. Factory Approach

- Extract patterns from Column 1
- Apply to Column 2 (US-006)
- Document for automation

## üìÅ Artifacts to Promote to Project Level

### Critical Documents (Promote These):

1. **US-005 Retrospective Document**
   - Location: `.sdlc/07-operations/retrospectives/us005-discussion.md`
   - Why: Team learnings and decisions

2. **BUSM-to-Supabase Synchronization Directive**
   - Location: `.sdlc/07-operations/implementation-directives/busm-sync-directive.md`
   - Why: Critical alignment on schema management

3. **Development-to-Deployment Validation Strategy**
   - Location: `.sdlc/07-operations/validation-strategy/validation_lifecycle_strategy.md`
   - Why: Addresses daily friction points

4. **Software Factory Vision**
   - Location: `.sdlc/01-planning/vision/software-factory-vision.md`
   - Why: North star for automation strategy

5. **SDLC Workflow Map**
   - Location: `.sdlc/01-planning/sdlc-workflow-map.md`
   - Why: Complete view of agents and processors

### Working Documents (Keep in Thread):

6. **Feature Document Evaluation**
   - Why: Active discussion, not final

7. **Master View Feature**
   - Why: Source document under evaluation

## üöÄ Next Thread Starting Points

### Option A: Continue Feature Evaluation

"Let's continue evaluating the Master View Feature document. We were discussing whether to improve the document first or proceed with US-006 and learn by doing."

### Option B: Fix Validation Issues

"CC identified critical validation issues. Let's implement the fixes from our validation strategy, starting with the phantom TypeScript rule."

### Option C: Build US-006

"Let's write US-006 in JTBD format and build Column 2, extracting patterns for the factory as we go."

### Option D: Review Mockups

"I have mockups for the Master View. Let's review them to fill the gaps we identified in the feature document."

## üí° Context for New Thread

**Key Question**: Should we perfect the process (documents, validation) or build and learn (US-006)?

**Team Positions**:

- **Human**: Wants collaborative, methodical approach with clear traceability
- **Claude**: Tends to rush but learning to slow down and be thorough
- **CC**: Ready to build, sees patterns, wants validation friction removed

**Critical Path**:

1. Decide on US-006 approach
2. Fix immediate validation blockers
3. Extract patterns for factory
4. Build remaining columns
