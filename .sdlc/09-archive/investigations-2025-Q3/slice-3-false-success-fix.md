# Slice 3 False Success - Investigation & Fix

## Problem
Slice 3 processors reported success but failed to create expected functionality:
- ❌ `useAccountSelection` hook not created
- ❌ Selection behavior not implemented
- ❌ AccountsList not wired up with selection

## Root Cause
1. **HOOK-PROCESSOR failed silently** - Reported success without creating the hook
2. **Test Twin confusion** - Test twin created test file but not the actual hook
3. **No integration** - Components weren't wired together to use selection

## What I Fixed

### 1. Created Missing Hook
**File**: `src/hooks/useAccountSelection.ts`
- Selection state management
- Toggle selection (click to select/deselect)
- Only one selected at a time

### 2. Integrated Selection in Main Page
**File**: `src/app/page.tsx`
- Added `useAccountSelection` hook
- Replaced single AccountCard with AccountsList
- Connected selection state to all components
- Added mock accounts for testing

### 3. Connected AccountDetailsPanel
- Shows selected account details
- Opens when account selected
- Closes when clicking X (deselects)

## How to Test
```bash
npm run dev
# Click different account cards - should select/deselect
# Only one selected at a time
# Details panel shows selected account
```

## Prevention Strategy

### 1. Always Run Validation After Processors
```bash
node scripts/validate-processor-output.js processor-manifest.json
```

### 2. Add to Pipeline Script
The pipeline should automatically validate outputs:
```bash
# After processors run
if ! node scripts/validate-processor-output.js "$MANIFEST"; then
  echo "ERROR: Processors failed to create expected files"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 3. Test Actual Behavior
Don't trust "success" - test the actual feature:
- Click interactions work
- State updates properly
- UI reflects changes

## Lessons Learned
1. **Processors can lie** - They report success without doing work
2. **Test twins aren't enough** - They test non-existent code
3. **Validation is critical** - Must verify actual outputs
4. **Manual implementation works** - Sometimes faster than debugging processors

## Status
✅ FIXED - Selection now works as expected:
- Click to select account
- Click selected to deselect
- Visual feedback working
- Only one selected at a time
