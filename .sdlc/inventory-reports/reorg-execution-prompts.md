**Date**: August 10, 2025  
**Purpose**: Step-by-step prompts for safe reorganization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS
1. **Execute prompts in STRICT order**
2. **STOP at each checkpoint for review**
3. **Do NOT proceed past a checkpoint without approval**
4. **Report issues immediately**

## üõë CHECKPOINT SYSTEM
- **GREEN CHECKPOINT** ‚úÖ = Safe to proceed after CC reports
- **YELLOW CHECKPOINT** üü° = Need human review before proceeding  
- **RED CHECKPOINT** üî¥ = STOP - Critical review required

---

## üö¶ Phase 0: Pre-Flight (NEW - Based on CC's Analysis)

### Prompt 1: Create Path Configuration System
```
@cc Please create the following path configuration system:

1. Create file: `.sdlc/config/path-config.json` with:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-08-10",
  "paths": {
    "manifestPath": ".sdlc/05-backlog/A-accounts/master-view/",
    "userStoriesPath": ".sdlc/05-backlog/A-accounts/",
    "sessionStatePath": ".sdlc/07-operations/A-session-tracking/",
    "currentWorkPath": ".sdlc/current-work/",
    "validationPath": ".sdlc/validation/",
    "processorsPath": ".sdlc/01-core/A-agents/processors/"
  },
  "migration": {
    "status": "pre-migration",
    "symlinksActive": false
  }
}
```

2. Update these scripts to use path-config.json:
   - scripts/run-slice.sh
   - scripts/extract-value-slices.js
   - scripts/validate-processor-output.js
   - scripts/run-processor-pipeline.sh

3. Test that all scripts still work with current paths

Report which scripts were updated and any that couldn't be found.
```

### ‚úÖ CHECKPOINT 1: Path Configuration Review
**Type**: GREEN - Safe to proceed after CC confirms:
- [ ] path-config.json created successfully
- [ ] All scripts updated to use config
- [ ] Scripts tested and working
- [ ] No hardcoded paths remain

---

### Prompt 2: Audit All Path References
```
@cc Please audit all path references in the project:

1. Check package.json for any scripts with paths
2. Review all .github/workflows/*.yml files for path references
3. Find all README files with relative links that might break
4. Search for hardcoded paths in:
   - *.js, *.ts, *.jsx, *.tsx files
   - *.sh files
   - *.md files

Output a report: `path-references-audit.md` listing all files that need updates.
```

### üü° CHECKPOINT 2: Path Audit Review  
**Type**: YELLOW - Need human review:
- [ ] Review path-references-audit.md
- [ ] Identify any critical paths CC found
- [ ] Decide if any need manual handling
- [ ] APPROVAL REQUIRED: "Proceed with Phase 1"

---

## üèÉ Phase 1: Safety First

### Prompt 3: Create Safety Checkpoint
```
@cc Please execute safety preparations:

1. Verify git status is clean:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. Create safety commit:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Pre-reorganization checkpoint - 149 files per audit"
   ```

3. Create and switch to reorganization branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/sdlc-product-separation-2025-08
   ```

4. Tag current state:
   ```bash
   git tag -a pre-reorg-v1.0 -m "State before product/SDLC separation"
   ```

5. Verify current work is complete:
   - Check if any active stories in progress
   - Confirm session-state.json is not mid-task

Report status of each step.
```

### ‚úÖ CHECKPOINT 3: Safety Verified
**Type**: GREEN - Safe to proceed after:
- [ ] Git status clean
- [ ] Branch created
- [ ] Current state tagged
- [ ] No active work in progress

---

## üìÅ Phase 2: Create New Structure

### Prompt 4: Build Target Directories
```
@cc Please create the new directory structure:

```bash
# Product specifications structure
mkdir -p .product-specs/00-platform-core/{vision,busm-model}
mkdir -p .product-specs/00-platform-core/epics/EP-001-accounts/{features,architecture}
mkdir -p .product-specs/00-platform-core/epics/EP-001-accounts/features/{FEA-001-master-view,FEA-002-reports}/stories
mkdir -p .product-specs/01-pest-control/{domain-model,features}
mkdir -p .product-specs/02-marine-services/{domain-model,features}

# SDLC improvements
mkdir -p .sdlc/09-archive/{investigations-2025-Q3,old-processors,old-manifests}
mkdir -p .sdlc/10-project-tracking/{config,iterations/current,metrics,reports}
mkdir -p .sdlc/11-reference/{patterns,templates,examples}

```
@cc Please archive obsolete files (CC's recommended order):

1. Archive old investigations (60-day retention per CC):
   ```bash
   # Move investigations older than 60 days
   git mv .sdlc/validation/investigations/completed/* .sdlc/09-archive/investigations-2025-Q3/
   ```

2. Archive old processor versions:
   ```bash
   git mv .sdlc/01-core/G-agent-archive/* .sdlc/09-archive/old-processors/
   ```

3. Archive OLD manifest versions (keep current processor-manifest.json):
   ```bash
   git mv .sdlc/05-backlog/A-accounts/master-view/processor-manifest-vs1.json .sdlc/09-archive/old-manifests/
   git mv .sdlc/05-backlog/A-accounts/master-view/processor-manifest-vs2.json .sdlc/09-archive/old-manifests/
   git mv .sdlc/05-backlog/A-accounts/master-view/processor-manifest-vs3.json .sdlc/09-archive/old-manifests/
