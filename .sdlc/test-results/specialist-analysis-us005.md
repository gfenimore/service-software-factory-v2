SPECIALIST ANALYSIS COMPLETE

Value Slice: Value Slice 1 - Basic Details Panel
Tasks Found: T-001, T-002, T-003, T-004

Specialists Required:
  T-001:
    - TYPE-DEFINER       # Reason: Found interface AccountDetailsPanelProps with typed props
    - NEXTJS-SCAFFOLDER  # Reason: Found component AccountDetailsPanel with TSX structure
    - REACT-PURIST       # Reason: Found onClick handler onClose() event

  T-002:
    - TYPE-DEFINER       # Reason: Found interface AccountCardProps extends ExistingProps
    - REACT-PURIST       # Reason: Found onClick={onViewDetails} event handler

  T-003:
    - TYPE-DEFINER       # Reason: Found interface UseAccountDetailsReturn with hook return types
    - STATE-WEAVER       # Reason: Found useAccountDetails hook pattern for state management

  T-004:
    - TYPE-DEFINER       # Reason: Found interface MasterViewState with detailsState types
    - ROUTE-INTEGRATOR   # Reason: Found integration arrows AccountMasterView --> useAccountDetails --> AccountDetailsPanel

Testing Phase:
  - UNIT-TESTER        # Reason: Found test blocks with render(), expect(), jest.fn()
  - INTEGRATION-TESTER # Reason: Found integration test for "clicking View Details opens panel"
  - BROWSER-VALIDATOR  # Reason: Found "Visual inspection in browser" and "Click test in browser"

Execution Order:
  1. TYPE-DEFINER       # Creates interfaces first
  2. NEXTJS-SCAFFOLDER  # Creates component files second
  3. STATE-WEAVER       # Creates custom hook third
  4. REACT-PURIST       # Adds event handlers fourth
  5. ROUTE-INTEGRATOR   # Connects all pieces fifth
  6. UNIT-TESTER        # Tests individual components
  7. INTEGRATION-TESTER # Tests component interactions
  8. BROWSER-VALIDATOR  # Tests user flows

Total Specialists: 8
Estimated Assembly Time: 2 hours based on complexity

Confidence Level: HIGH
Missing Information: None - all patterns clearly identified with explicit interfaces and integration flows
```

## Binary Gates Verification

1. Did I identify all components? **Y** - Found 4 components across 4 tasks with clear interfaces
2. Did I map all tasks to specialists? **Y** - Each task T-001 through T-004 mapped to required specialists
3. Did I order specialists by dependencies? **Y** - Types first, then components, then integration, then testing
4. Is the execution sequence clear? **Y** - Clear dependency chain from foundation to validation

## Pattern Detection Summary

**TYPE-DEFINER Triggers Found:**
- `interface AccountDetailsPanelProps`
- `interface Account` 
- `interface UseAccountDetailsReturn`
- `interface AccountCardProps extends ExistingProps`
- `interface MasterViewState`

**NEXTJS-SCAFFOLDER Triggers Found:**
- Component definition: `AccountDetailsPanel`
- TSX structure with proper client boundaries

**REACT-PURIST Triggers Found:**
- `onClick={onViewDetails}` event handler
- `onClose()` event handler
- State management needs in components

**STATE-WEAVER Triggers Found:**
- `useAccountDetails` hook pattern
- Custom hook managing state: `selectedAccountForDetails`, `isDetailsOpen`

**ROUTE-INTEGRATOR Triggers Found:**
- Integration arrows: `AccountMasterView --> useAccountDetails --> AccountDetailsPanel`
- Flow connections: `AccountCard --> onViewDetails() --> useAccountDetails.openDetailsFor()`

**Testing Triggers Found:**
- `test()` blocks with component rendering
- Integration test descriptions
- "Visual inspection" and browser validation requirements
